1
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,484
So-yeon.

2
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,158
Yes.

3
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,828
So-yeon.

4
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,206
So-yeon.

5
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,128
Give it a little time.

6
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,714
You'll be born again.

7
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,232
Gi-su!

8
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,317
Yang Gi-su!

9
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,156
Stop.

10
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,533
Let So-yeon go now.

11
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,994
I'm gonna bring her back.

12
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,455
She'll die anyway if you stop me.

13
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,874
- Sir, I will shoot you.
- Gi-su.

14
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,128
Your horrific human experiments
have taken over 100 lives.

15
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,214
This is not going to bring So-yeon back.

16
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,301
If you really want to save your daughter,
let her go.

17
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,971
No, I've found a way. I've succeeded!

18
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,641
See here. I'm living proof.

19
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,351
I tested it on myself.

20
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,187
We can bring So-yeon back now.

21
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,981
Yang Gi-su!

22
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,157
No, you can't.

23
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,118
Don't touch it!

24
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,201
Take him away.

25
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:27,249
So-yeon is going to die.
You're going to kill her!

26
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
STRONG EARTHQUAKE ALERT

27
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,104
So-yeon.

28
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,505
No!

29
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,120
BADLAND HUNTERS

30
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,168
What the hell?

31
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,757
Shit, I'm so fucked.

32
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,395
Help me! Someone help!

33
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,606
Get away from me!

34
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,087
Hey, come on over here.

35
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,881
I pretty much had that in the bag.

36
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,676
Who cares who bags it? Let's take it all.

37
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,345
That looks delicious.

38
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,283
I told you to let me know
if there's any work to be done.

39
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,285
I'm fine, Su-na.

40
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,705
I just went out to get some air.

41
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,541
Grandma, you have bad knees.

42
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,751
Take a seat. I'll handle the rest.

43
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,883
I can't recall the last time it rained.

44
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,181
There's no drinking water
around this area.

45
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,563
Su-na, why don't we find a car

46
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,024
and move to Bus District?

47
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,902
I think

48
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,239
I'll just live here with you, Grandma.

49
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,994
It's not like we'd be safe there
just because there are more people.

50
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,122
Remember when we got dragged off
by those cannibals?

51
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,917
They also used to be kind people
before the drought.

52
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,880
Not everyone in the world
is evil like that.

53
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,761
Well, most of the people I've seen
have been like that.

54
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,014
Su-na.

55
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,726
This is what I think.

56
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,730
You reap what you sow.

57
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,733
It may seem like
there are many bad people,

58
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,610
but keep embracing people,

59
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,196
and you'll definitely come across
some nice ones.

60
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,448
That's what I believe.

61
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,659
You put way too much faith in people.

62
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,662
That might've been the case
before the world ended.

63
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:44,501
Sadly, I don't really remember
what things were like back then.

64
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,216
Actually, we might have to visit
Bus District today.

65
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,803
- Oh, is today the day Nam San is coming?
- Yeah.

66
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,016
How much longer
do we have to put up with dirty water?

67
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,976
We haven't had a drop of rain for months.

68
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,063
This is nothing.

69
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,483
Last year, we had a drought
for over six months.

70
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,713
Hey! We've got meat!

71
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:31,923
Hurry on over!

72
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,384
All right, line up, everyone! Line up!

73
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,136
Have your trading goods ready.

74
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,596
Hey, mister! Stand in line properly.

75
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,393
Okay.

76
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:45,853
Rubber boots.

77
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,897
- San.
- Rubber boots?

78
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,817
Next.

79
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,612
No, that won't do.

80
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,905
Looks fine to me.

81
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,288
Here, take it.

82
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,710
Damn, you scared me.

83
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,263
This should be enough

84
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,185
to get me that entire tail portion.

85
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,687
The whole thing.

86
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,356
Can you eat this? Put it away.

87
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:35,236
Once this situation dies down
and things get better,

88
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,531
- this will...
- You sure are optimistic, lady.

89
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,911
It's been over three years
since the world ended.

90
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,746
It's time you accept reality!

91
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,790
Hey, here. At least take this. Here.

92
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,669
We really shouldn't do this,
but we'll give it to you in secret.

93
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,671
Do I eat it raw?

94
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,632
Cook it first. It's venomous.

95
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,604
What is it?

96
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,687
- Rice.
- Rice?

97
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:14,608
Thank you.

98
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,111
- Hello, Ji-wan.
- Su-na!

99
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,071
Hello, mister.

100
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,949
Hey, Su-na. Hello, ma'am.

101
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,033
Hello.

102
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,118
You don't have to come all the way here.

103
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,247
We could've visited on our way home.
It must be hard for your grandma.

104
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,124
Oh goodness. No, we should come.

105
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,253
Su-na owes her life to Nam San, after all.

106
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,880
It's already been three years.

107
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,925
We've relied on your help for so long,
so I just feel bad.

108
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,634
You didn't have to.

109
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,262
Thank you, ma'am.

110
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,099
I'm just glad
Su-na's grown up to be a fine person.

111
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,475
Thank you, mister.

112
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,601
Sure.

113
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,104
- Right, well, take some meat today.
- Su-na.

114
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,856
I caught this alligator.

115
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,693
Are you sure it wasn't Mr. Nam San?

116
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,944
It really was me.

117
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,906
I'd like to trade this in, mister.

118
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,702
Your painting? Let's see now.

119
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,579
Wow, a masterpiece.

120
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,205
It's amazing.

121
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,083
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

122
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,627
Where's mine? I go out on hunts with him.

123
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,839
We should make way now.
There are people waiting.

124
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,922
I'm so sorry.

125
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,300
See you, mister.

126
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,676
Take care. Goodbye, ma'am.

127
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,177
- We'll be on our way.
- See you.

128
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,261
Next.

129
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,661
Man, they've practically set up
a fucking village here.

130
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,330
Living diligently, I see. Damn.

131
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,877
Listen up, residents of Bus District!

132
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,670
Let us introduce ourselves.

133
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,382
We're from Jamsil Police Station, okay?

134
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,176
Look at this. See this thing?

135
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:07,430
As long as you folks cooperate,

136
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,141
no one's going to get hurt, okay?

137
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,686
Fuck, no one's answering.

138
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,397
Well, the reason we are here…

139
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,857
Let's see. Here it is.

140
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,527
We're on the hunt
for a notorious criminal,

141
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,863
and it just so happened

142
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,908
that we picked up on his scent
in this neighborhood.

143
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:31,120
So I'd like to ask
for your cooperation. Okay?

144
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,830
Wait. Hey.

145
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,042
Hey, that guy looks just like him. See?

146
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,794
- It looks like him.
- Take him.

147
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,172
It's not me!

148
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,594
Hey, over there.
Take the one covered in gold.

149
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:53,643
Let go. I'm a woman.

150
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,062
Yeah, I know. This guy's a woman.

151
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,145
He's a woman?

152
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,150
Hey! You!

153
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:04,778
Let's go.

154
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,156
Let go. Damn it.

155
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,993
You're strong, you fuck.

156
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,996
Are you really a cop?

157
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,423
What did we say?
Cooperate, or you'll get hurt.

158
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,393
How old are you?

159
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,353
What's it to you?

160
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,313
I'm just glad to see you.

161
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,108
Kids your age have all but disappeared.

162
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,026
Please go away. You smell foul.

163
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,278
Let's go.

164
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,116
This crazy bitch.

165
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,118
- That bastard.
- What did you say?

166
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,786
Stop it, you punk!

167
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,496
Seriously.

168
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
- Grandma!
- You fucker!

169
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,876
Su-na, are you okay?

170
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,398
Hey, hold it.

171
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,483
Go.

172
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,817
Move.

173
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,158
What the fuck are you doing?

174
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,720
Die!

175
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,806
That tickles.

176
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,320
Are you the boss?

177
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,822
No, I'm not the boss, sir.

178
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,074
Then who's your boss?

179
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,327
Well, it's Tiger, sir.

180
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,454
Tiger? That prick is still alive?

181
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,711
Hey, where did you get this water?

182
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,505
From the apartment, sir.

183
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,131
- Apartment?
- Yes, sir.

184
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,842
I've gone far beyond this area
but never seen apartments.

185
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:32,927
I'm not lying, sir.

186
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,762
It's quite far from here,

187
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,641
surrounded by unusual terrain,
so it's rather hard to see.

188
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,560
There's clean water there, sir.

189
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,272
Listen, if you ever come here again,
I'll kill you all. Got it?

190
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,773
Yes, sir. I understand.

191
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,358
Make sure you tell Tiger.

192
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,441
Yes, sir.

193
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,740
But who should I say you are?

194
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,535
Nam San.

195
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,954
Oh, you're <i>the </i>Nam San.

196
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,748
Yes, sir. I understand.

197
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,292
Hey, get up.

198
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,751
I'm so sorry, sir.

199
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,252
Hurry up!

200
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,928
Are you okay? And you, ma'am?

201
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,638
I'm fine. How about you?

202
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,182
I'm all right.

203
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,066
You're cute.

204
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,073
Nam San.

205
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,754
You know, all that talk earlier
might not have been complete bullshit.

206
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,921
What talk?

207
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,093
Well, that prick said
he got that water from an apartment.

208
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,141
Apparently, the place really exists.
People are dying to go there.

209
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,395
I heard it's packed with people
and practically heaven on earth.

210
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,776
You should go if you want.

211
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,736
I'm just curious. That's all.

212
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,406
Besides, you don't get to just go there.

213
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,492
Only the chosen ones get to enter.

214
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,081
Who are those punks?

215
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,336
Su-na!

216
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:32,754
Hey.

217
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,506
Who are you guys?

218
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,428
It's fine. They're not bad people.

219
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,139
It's really okay, mister.

220
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,891
She's a teacher.

221
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,725
What teacher?

222
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,062
Hello. Nice to meet you.

223
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,482
We happen to have
a safe place set up in Seoul.

224
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,402
I'm a teacher
and the leader of a volunteer group there.

225
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,904
They must be from the place
I mentioned earlier.

226
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,740
But why us?

227
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:05,371
We're prioritizing the protection
of families with children in their teens.

228
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,457
We believe we must protect our youth
for humanity's future.

229
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,335
Su-na, if you come with us,

230
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,588
your grandmother will live
a long, healthy life.

231
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,508
We have clean water and food
ready for you.

232
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,301
Clean water?

233
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,138
Oh my, thank the Lord.

234
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,099
Such an amazing place
must be a target of gangs.

235
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,393
How will you ensure safety?

236
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,274
We have an armed security force
with ex-military personnel.

237
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,402
Gangs roaming the wastelands
wouldn't dare make a move on us.

238
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,697
Could these two join us as well?

239
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,116
They're like family to me.

240
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,199
I'm sorry.

241
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,662
We're only accepting immediate family.

242
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,498
Ma'am,

243
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,625
have you not decided yet?

244
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,546
I hope you can make the right decision
for Su-na's sake.

245
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,133
If you pass on this,
other children may take the spot.

246
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:04,096
Well, my grandma's rather unwell,
so she won't be able to walk for too long.

247
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,307
We have medical staff at the halfway point

248
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,269
to ensure the safe transport
of those with health issues.

249
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,688
She's right. Let's go, Su-na.

250
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,774
Anywhere should be better than here.

251
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,443
That's right.
You should live in a better place.

252
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,616
I'll come to see you.

253
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,537
Okay.

254
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,997
You too, mister.

255
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,624
Please come to see me.

256
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,209
Yes, I'll do that.

257
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,128
Just a second, Grandma.

258
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,047
Mr. Nam San.

259
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,426
Thank you for all your help.

260
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,595
Don't mention it. Take care, ma'am.

261
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,306
Keep well, ma'am.

262
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,735
It's just a practice sketch.

263
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,613
Thank you.

264
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,078
It'll be hard to walk once the sun sets.
Let's hurry now.

265
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,287
Oh, okay.

266
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:11,913
- Grandma.
- Okay.

267
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,518
When did she get such a good look at me?

268
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,901
Su-na definitely has a crush on me, right?

269
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,403
As if.

270
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,409
What joy is there in life
now that Su-na has left us?

271
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,786
This place is too dangerous
for Su-na to live.

272
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,956
Events like today's happen far too often.

273
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,252
Well, you could keep her safe
in the future, like today.

274
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,339
Me, protect someone?

275
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,133
I couldn't even keep my own daughter safe.

276
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,885
Jeez.

277
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,220
You're at it again.

278
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,856
But Su-na sure does look
a lot like your daughter.

279
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:22,902
Wait!

280
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,573
If you get married and adopt me,
wouldn't we also get into that apartment?

281
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,574
Right?

282
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,451
How about the lady covered in gold?

283
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,369
- Hey.
- I'm dead serious.

284
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,205
The world might've ended,
but I can't just give up on life.

285
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,792
- My love just wasn't meant to be.
- Jesus Christ.

286
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:42,129
A loving married couple resemble
each other. You two already look alike.

287
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,173
Besides, she'd look stunning with makeup.

288
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,468
Hey, she put the snake in her nose.
Who does that?

289
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,345
That's enough, okay? Enough.

290
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,393
Going somewhere?

291
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,356
You're blabbering too much. I'm going out.

292
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,856
On a night hunt?

293
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,068
- Yeah.
- Let me come with you.

294
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,079
Grandma, are you okay?

295
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,164
Yes, I'm all right.

296
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,208
- Don't mind me.
- Mind your step.

297
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,647
Don't worry.
They're from our volunteer group.

298
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,357
Oh, right.

299
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,419
They're families from the west.

300
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,962
Thank you for your hard work.

301
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,881
Thank you all for coming this far.

302
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,091
Nice to meet you.

303
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,302
Follow me carefully this way, please.

304
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,442
I'm Lee Ju-ye. I'm 18. You?

305
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,989
I'm Han Su-na. I'm also 18.

306
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,407
Really? Wanna be friends?

307
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,119
Sure, let's be friends.

308
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,622
I haven't met a friend my age
in a really long time.

309
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:41,706
Same.

310
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,044
There wasn't anyone my age
in my neighborhood either.

311
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,337
Where did you live?

312
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:51,800
I lived in a tent
near Bus District with Grandma.

313
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,928
Nice to meet you, Ju-ye.

314
00:25:56,346 --> 00:26:00,142
My parents made me live underground
because it wasn't safe outside.

315
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,853
That must've been rough.

316
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,397
Most of it was bearable,

317
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,777
but the bugs and rats
would crawl up my body.

318
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,155
I had to keep moving my arms and legs

319
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,909
in case they mistook me for a corpse
and tore into me.

320
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,956
At least we can put that kind of life
behind us now.

321
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,501
Yeah, I heard the place is amazing.

322
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,045
I'll take a shower as soon as I get there.

323
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,506
It still feels like
the bugs are on my skin.

324
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,264
I wonder if Su-na's there yet.

325
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,184
I wish I could go there with Su-na.

326
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:48,023
Man, I really don't want to let her go.

327
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,400
We can just go see her.

328
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,484
Nope.

329
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:53,570
That lady in gold.

330
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,740
The stepmom I'd really like.

331
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,410
Hey, okay. I won't.

332
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,328
Careful.

333
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,378
Grandma, are you all right?

334
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,215
Let's stop for a moment.

335
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,343
Let's take Su-na's grandmother

336
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:20,305
and your father to the medical station
I mentioned earlier.

337
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:24,643
It's dangerous terrain from here on.
We wouldn't want you to strain yourselves.

338
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,355
Mr. Oh and Mr. Choi here
are going to take you there.

339
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,606
Thank you.

340
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,693
Thank you so much
for taking such good care of us.

341
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,738
Please take good care of my grandma.

342
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,949
Of course. You don't have to worry.

343
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,827
Mr. Choi.

344
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,328
I'll take good care of her.

345
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,585
- I'll take him from here.
- Thank you.

346
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,295
Slowly.

347
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,422
Father, I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

348
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,593
All right, let's be off now, then.

349
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,933
Su-na, don't worry about me
and go on ahead.

350
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:20,991
Idiot.

351
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,491
Nothing here.

352
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,994
Let's just check our snare trap.

353
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,454
Okay.

354
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,554
These are our vehicles.

355
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,891
We can take the cars from here.

356
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,516
Excuse me.

357
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:52,314
If the cars were this close,
we could have taken my grandma with us.

358
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,941
We can wait, then.

359
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,903
Everyone walked all night.
A few more hours of waiting won't hurt.

360
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,739
Right, everyone?

361
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,408
Mom, I'm thirsty.

362
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,160
We don't have any water.

363
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,703
Hang in there.

364
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,624
Oh my, what do we do?

365
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:14,670
We'll send a car back here tomorrow.

366
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,296
Please don't worry.

367
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,132
Let's get going, everyone.

368
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,759
Get in, everyone.

369
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,430
- Thank you.
- Sure.

370
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,724
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

371
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,107
Don't worry too much about your grandma.
I'm sure she'll be fine.

372
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,276
Get a head count.

373
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,874
There are still people doing
such good things these days.

374
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,295
Goodness, he's right.
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

375
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,754
Don't mention it.

376
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,507
All right, we've reached our destination.

377
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,146
Where's the medical facility?

378
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,730
Down there.

379
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:23,738
Is that Grandma?

380
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,533
Grandma!

381
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,095
Grandma. Wake up, Grandma!

382
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,128
What's with these bastards?

383
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,437
What the hell?

384
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,662
Come at me, dickhead.

385
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,879
Why did you kill Grandma?

386
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,215
Useless ones deserve to die.

387
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,259
You fucking son of a bitch!

388
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,263
Su-na. Where is she?

389
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,077
Just die!

390
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,007
Ji-wan!

391
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,887
Who the hell are you?

392
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,778
San, we have to go now.
Su-na is in danger.

393
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,281
Calm down. Let's clean this place first.

394
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,617
Are you leaving Grandma like that?

395
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,690
We're almost there, everyone.

396
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,651
Please pack your personal belongings.

397
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,621
You came here to see me?

398
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,417
Yes, I need your help.

399
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,629
I must save the apartment's residents
and my subordinates.

400
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,632
So why did you come to us for help?

401
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,093
Also, what's with these bastards?
And the apartment?

402
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,928
Hey, you stay out of this.

403
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,263
Help me, please.

404
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,895
They didn't seem human.
Chopping their heads off will kill them?

405
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:24,979
That's right.

406
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,984
What are these things?

407
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,030
<i>My name is Lee Eun-ho.</i>

408
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,741
<i>I was a sergeant
in a CCU Air Force special ops unit.</i>

409
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,788
- Heading down to find survivors.
- Yes, sir.

410
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,549
<i>We were watching from the sky
on the day of the great earthquake.</i>

411
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:58,471
<i>During our search for survivors, we found
an apartment that hadn't collapsed.</i>

412
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,018
<i>Our unit struck an aquifer there.</i>

413
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,230
<i>And with the survivors,
we did our best to rebuild the apartment.</i>

414
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,566
<i>But one day,</i>

415
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,403
<i>this man came to us.</i>

416
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
<i>Yang Gi-su.</i>

417
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,783
<i>The only doctor who survived.</i>

418
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,703
<i>He was helpful as a doctor,</i>

419
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,624
<i>but one day, he showed his true colors.</i>

420
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,378
Dr. Yang, I came to check something.

421
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,547
Some parents have complained.

422
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,924
Their children never came back
after you took them.

423
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,885
What's going on?

424
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,306
Lee Eun-ho,
what do you think you're doing?

425
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,350
Hurry up and explain.

426
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,517
Sergeant Kwon.

427
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,189
Don't you think it's time
for Sergeant Lee to know too?

428
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,109
Eun-ho, there's no hope in this world.

429
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,570
Now we must…

430
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,407
put our faith in Dr. Yang.

431
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,201
I merely gave him some advice,

432
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,870
along with a little gift.

433
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,922
- What are you doing now?
- Take a look.

434
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,299
This is Dr. Yang's latest breakthrough.

435
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,401
Sergeant Lee Eun-ho?

436
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,111
Look at me.

437
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:40,615
I mean, how do you think
someone like me managed to survive

438
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,826
that horrible great earthquake.

439
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:47,163
I once went two or three months
without any water.

440
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,166
I am the future of humanity.

441
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,837
This apartment won't last long anyway.
Everyone's going to die.

442
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,172
Failure to embrace change
means everyone dies.

443
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,176
I'll help you survive.

444
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,637
You crazy bastard.

445
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,973
Where are the children?

446
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,349
- Take her away.
- Where?!

447
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,433
Calm down.

448
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,186
Let me go, you bastard!

449
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,485
Hey, Lee Eun-ho!

450
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:28,830
It seems Yang Gi-su has been conducting
strange experiments on people.

451
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,167
They ended up that way
because of the experiments.

452
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,002
- If you help me...
- Hey.

453
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,756
I'm going to go get Su-na now.

454
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,343
If you get in my way,
I'm going to kill you first.

455
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,094
Got it?

456
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:58,151
Our apartment has over 30 families
residing in it,

457
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,863
and it can provide them with electricity
with the solar panels we set up.

458
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,786
LET US FORGE A NEW FUTURE

459
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,331
Is that lettuce?

460
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,540
I see tomatoes too.

461
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,339
WELCOME, NEW RESIDENTS

462
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,174
WELCOME TO THE FUTURE OF NEW HUMANITY

463
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,218
Please make way.

464
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,807
Dr. Yang Gi-su is coming out.

465
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,272
Hello, everyone.

466
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,526
My name is Yang Gi-su,
and I'm in charge of this place.

467
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,572
Welcome, everyone.

468
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,577
You must've endured
numerous hardships out there

469
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,872
where conditions were truly dreadful.

470
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:57,001
You all went through so much out there
where countless barbarians roamed freely.

471
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,671
But you don't need to worry anymore.

472
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:04,801
We will be providing you
with clean water and food,

473
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,513
and we will keep you safe
from outside threats.

474
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,268
Right. Get them some water first.

475
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,190
That's clean water we purified
in this apartment.

476
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,574
My grandma should be arriving soon.

477
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,325
Can I have one more, please?

478
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:32,703
Thank you.

479
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:15,079
They've been taking children,
just like they took Su-na.

480
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,082
They must be the subject
of the experiment.

481
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,918
Those sons of bitches! Damn it!

482
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,754
Let's go. We gotta save Su-na now!

483
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,047
Got a death wish?

484
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,591
Rushing in recklessly won't help.

485
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,345
Their security is tighter
than you'd expect.

486
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,139
They shoot trespassers on sight.

487
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:37,352
Come daybreak, I'll take care
of the guards at the main gate

488
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,354
and keep the others distracted.

489
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,607
If you get into the underground prison
and rescue my associates,

490
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,693
we can join forces.

491
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:49,197
You sure we can trust
these associates of yours or whatever?

492
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,159
Again with the disrespectful language,
punk-ass kid.

493
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,494
How old are you?

494
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,537
I'm fucking 18, woman.

495
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,373
- You wanna die?
- Damn it. Let go!

496
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,042
Hey, stop it,
or you'll grow to like each other.

497
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,003
Let's think this over.

498
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,394
Amen. Yeah.

499
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,776
Boss, I've taken care of them all.

500
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,029
Hurry up and fight!

501
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,406
Hey, man.

502
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,949
- Go at it.
- Hey.

503
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,330
Wanna see your wife squirt blood all over?

504
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,441
Fuck, we lost again!

505
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,947
Hey, Pung-gi.

506
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,783
Got anything left to wager?

507
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,453
You fat-ass, chrome-dome prick.

508
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,288
There's one left, for fuck's sake.

509
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:34,135
Man, I saved your ass from life in prison,
only to have you disrespect me like this.

510
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,179
- Show some respect, prick.
- Fuck them up!

511
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,061
You motherfucker. Come here.

512
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:45,937
Fuck.

513
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:48,732
Tiger!

514
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,318
What, you bastard?

515
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,491
Hey, fucking kill them all!

516
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:13,758
Everyone stop!

517
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,554
Where's Tiger?

518
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:21,182
Look who it is.

519
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,142
It's been a while, Nam San.

520
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:26,104
There's that bastard.
Red and plump like a sweet potato.

521
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,730
Sir, that's the bastard.

522
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:28,856
He's a beast.

523
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,860
Thanks to you,
I quit boxing and got totally fucked over.

524
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:36,280
I've waited my whole life for this,
and you just walk up to your own grave.

525
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:39,075
I came here to ask you something,
but I changed my mind

526
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,202
since I don't like your attitude.

527
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,539
- I'll beat you up like the old days.
- We're not in the ring anymore.

528
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,416
Street fighting is different,
you son of a bitch!

529
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,627
Hey, Pung-gi.

530
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:53,631
If you bring down that gorilla,
I'll give you half my slaves.

531
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,714
Half?

532
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,220
You're next once I've killed that prick,
you fat bastard.

533
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,972
Kill that gorilla!

534
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,629
That fucker.

535
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,397
Hurry! Get out of there!

536
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:10,625
Wait.

537
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,169
Damn. That really hurts.

538
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,508
- It hurts so much.
- Get up. Come here.

539
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,135
Hey, run!

540
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,219
Hey!

541
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,894
Oh God, my chin hurts so badly.

542
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,325
Hello.

543
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,912
Could you please tell me
when my grandma will be arriving?

544
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:48,995
Grandma?

545
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,082
Whose grandma?

546
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:55,544
We sent them a ride this morning,
so she should arrive before dinnertime.

547
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,756
Don't worry.
Why don't you return to your spot?

548
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,049
Okay.

549
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,055
Aren't you trying too hard for a kid?

550
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,349
Children are our hope.

551
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:10,935
We can't let them down.

552
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,148
Our hope is Dr. Yang Gi-su, okay?

553
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:27,326
Today is the day we announce
the much-anticipated cumulative grades.

554
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,746
First place,

555
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,332
Kim Hak-yong.

556
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,585
Unit 604. Lee Gyu-yeon, Unit 607.

557
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,755
Third place. Choi Ju-yeong, Unit 601.

558
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,091
Fourth place. Jang Chang-su, Unit 608.

559
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,467
Excuse me.

560
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,179
What grades is he talking about?
We're new here.

561
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,515
The family of the student who comes first

562
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:53,060
gets assigned
to the nicest apartment unit.

563
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,354
I'm so jealous of you.

564
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,690
My child always comes last.

565
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,234
Family members of the student
with top grades

566
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,279
will be exempted from work
and given a free meal pass.

567
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,948
Family members of Kim Hak-yong,
please step forward.

568
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,787
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

569
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:13,913
Thank you.

570
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,626
You can also come in first, right?

571
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:18,794
Of course.

572
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,672
Students are our hope!

573
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,382
Students are our future!

574
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,511
Everyone, please have faith
in your children and cheer them on!

575
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,231
All right, it's time to say your goodbyes.

576
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,568
As we explained before,
students will live on the eighth floor.

577
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,651
- What?
- What?

578
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,072
You never mentioned that.

579
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:49,992
We explained it to your grandmother.
Didn't she tell you?

580
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,373
Does that mean
I won't live with my grandma?

581
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,458
Does that mean we can't see Ju-ye?

582
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,837
If you sign up for a meeting,
I'll make sure you get to see her.

583
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:04,006
Can we see her anytime by signing up?

584
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,090
Of course.

585
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:08,594
I'll get going now.
I'll be sure to come first.

586
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,221
Don't skip any meals, okay?

587
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,390
- Let's go.
- Look after her.

588
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,309
Right, please take good care of her.

589
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,812
As for the parents, please follow me.

590
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,814
Listen to your brother.
We'll see you soon.

591
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,024
- Okay.
- Seong-won, take good care of Gyu-rin.

592
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:23,108
Okay.

593
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:24,819
This way.

594
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,472
This is the clean water
that our children drink.

595
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,393
If you look here,
you'll see the steps we take

596
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,813
to filtrate the spoiled water
to make the potable water we drink.

597
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,356
It's the most precious water.

598
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,157
San, they even have guns here.

599
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:12,907
Right.

600
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:18,122
Hey, where did you guys get
these guns and water?

601
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,500
You got them
from the apartment, didn't you?

602
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,589
- You don't know?
- Well, do we know where we got it?

603
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,672
What?

604
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,134
So, do you know?

605
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,136
I don't know. Not me.

606
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,596
Okay. Take a nap, then.

607
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,559
What about you?

608
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,478
- I don't exactly…
- Lights out.

609
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:44,315
- You? You don't know, do you?
- No.

610
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,524
What about you?

611
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:48,276
You don't know.

612
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:53,157
What about you? Do you know? You don't?

613
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,662
You don't know anything.

614
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,080
- I actually do.
- You don't.

615
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:04,126
I'm the only one who goes to make deals.
You're going to need me, sir.

616
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,266
Excuse me.

617
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,311
Do we have to do this work every day?

618
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,440
This is what we do all day.

619
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,867
They have a monopoly on all the water.

620
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,494
Really clean water at that.

621
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,954
They have a monopoly on it?

622
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,206
Yes, and with that comes power.

623
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,208
All they have to do is sit on their asses

624
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,419
while gangs like us
bring goods to them for some water.

625
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:48,921
And what do you bring them?

626
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,339
People.

627
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,050
At first, they were fine with us
bringing in anyone,

628
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,886
but now they only want us
to bring in children.

629
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,555
- Kids in their teens.
- Why children?

630
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,139
Well, I don't know about that.

631
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,933
And you still sold people to them?

632
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,184
- Hey.
- What the…?

633
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:03,811
- Hold up.
- Come on, relax.

634
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,271
When you came to Bus District

635
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:08,190
and tried to fucking take Su-na,
that was why?

636
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,359
- Yeah.
- You son of a bitch.

637
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,360
Hey, relax.

638
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,612
Hey, pals. Why are you so hotheaded?

639
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:15,823
- Hey, let it go.
- Let me go, okay?

640
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,616
There, there. Let it go.

641
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,326
We had to make a living too.

642
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,329
So? How do you guys enter the premises?

643
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,414
We…

644
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,251
can only enter on delivery days.

645
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,919
The days we deliver the goods.

646
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:29,837
Delivery days?

647
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,339
All right, you must be tired talking.
Take a nap.

648
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,884
Well, I'm actually not that tired.

649
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:36,968
Nah, take a nap.

650
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:46,353
Mr. Choi took care
of the children's elderly guardians.

651
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:50,107
The new children, both 18-year-old girls,
are Han Su-na and Lee Ju-ye.

652
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:54,820
With our two new recruits,
we have a total of 19.

653
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,281
They're a lot healthier than we expected.

654
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,867
- I see. Please keep a close eye on them.
- Okay.

655
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,954
They probably didn't drink clean water
for a while. You know what to do.

656
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,456
I'll have everything ready.

657
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,167
I'll visit them this evening.

658
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,250
You can go now.

659
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,463
You should wipe your face.

660
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,672
Just go.

661
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,517
Hello, everyone.

662
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,897
Here. Come this way.

663
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,148
Stand here.

664
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,735
Attention. Bow.

665
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,403
Nice to meet you.

666
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,867
All right, everyone.
Today, we have new friends joining us.

667
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:45,287
- Introduce yourself first, Ju-ye.
- Okay.

668
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,123
My name is Lee Ju-ye.

669
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:52,795
I'm 18, and I like eating.

670
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,963
I don't like bugs.

671
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,173
Nice to meet you all.

672
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:59,385
Wow, let's give her a hand.
It's so nice to have you.

673
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:00,594
And you, Su-na.

674
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:04,847
Su-na?

675
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,894
Don't be nervous. Just talk comfortably.

676
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:15,901
My name is Han Su-na.

677
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:19,113
I like drawing, and I don't like…

678
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,241
communal life.

679
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:26,912
Wow, let's give her a round of applause!

680
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:30,249
You can go sit
in those empty seats over there.

681
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,458
- Okay.
- Off you go.

682
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:34,502
Hello.

683
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,881
All right, today,

684
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:41,385
we'll be learning
about the purposes of metabolic changes.

685
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,177
Open your books.

686
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:47,099
Let's first discuss
the current human body structure.

687
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,394
Our physical limitations
meant we had to drink water

688
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,688
and consume food in order to survive,

689
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:57,818
so we've wasted so many resources
on people who were of no help.

690
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,238
These are known weaknesses.

691
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,866
And with a shortage of water
in our current world,

692
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:08,328
humanity needs a new body structure
that can overcome these weaknesses.

693
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,166
Our goal is to come up
with a new metabolic system,

694
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,418
allowing us to create a breed of humanity

695
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:18,338
capable of surviving for a long time
without water and sustenance.

696
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,300
We aim to increase
the gradually declining human population

697
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:26,513
so that we can open up the possibility
of returning to a civilized society.

698
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:30,350
Therefore, with both water and food
scarce in this world,

699
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:34,188
you must never forget
Dr. Yang Gi-su's mercy

700
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:37,107
and do your duty.

701
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:41,403
Once we improve our metabolic systems
through Dr. Yang's research,

702
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:46,825
humanity will finally be given a body
that can adapt to this new world.

703
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:48,744
Focus, Su-na.

704
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:53,749
I don't understand.

705
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,794
People outside don't even have
enough water to drink,

706
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:59,338
but people here drink freely
and even take showers.

707
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,508
Everyone here goes on and on
about Dr. Yang Gi-su,

708
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:07,304
but why won't Dr. Yang Gi-su
share water with those people?

709
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:14,603
Su-na.

710
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,314
The outside world is full of barbarians.

711
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:21,401
Dr. Yang lost his beloved daughter
because of people like that.

712
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,572
To be a part of the new humanity,

713
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,117
you need the right qualifications.

714
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,955
What kind of qualifications are needed?

715
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,000
People that help
with the doctor's research.

716
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,711
I'd also like to help
with the doctor's research.

717
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,717
It seems you have what it takes, Ju-ye.

718
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,679
Please help Su-na understand, Ju-ye.

719
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,013
Yes, ma'am.

720
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:52,724
Now, for our next lesson,

721
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:55,936
we'll learn about organisms
that excel at survival.

722
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,273
Dr. Yang will be visiting us later on,

723
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:04,987
so let's all express our gratitude
by giving him a hearty welcome.

724
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,738
Yes, ma'am.

725
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,748
You know this food comes
from your parents' hard work, right?

726
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,668
Let us all dig in with a thankful heart.

727
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,754
And there's water,
the world's most precious thing.

728
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,507
Make sure to drink it all down
to the very last drop.

729
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:31,305
Dr. Yang Gi-su had them
specially purified for you all.

730
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,891
Ju-ye.

731
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,894
Hello, everyone.

732
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,812
A round of applause, everyone.

733
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,608
Attention. Bow.

734
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,321
"Students are our hope."

735
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,573
Surely you know our apartment's motto.

736
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:53,952
That's why we're supplying our students
with special food and water.

737
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:58,874
As you know, we live in a world
with a great shortage of food and water.

738
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:03,045
I'm working day and night
in order to create a world

739
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:07,549
in which we'll be able to survive
on only a small amount of food and water.

740
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:10,928
Until that day comes,
please make sure to finish everything

741
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,472
and not leave any precious food or water.

742
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,555
Yes, sir.

743
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:16,934
- Yes?
- Doctor.

744
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:18,976
Oh, there?

745
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,855
- Her name is?
- It's Lee Ju-ye.

746
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,608
- Lee Ju-ye.
- Yes, sir.

747
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,654
- Eighteen years old?
- Yes, sir.

748
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,406
I heard that you wanted
to help in my research.

749
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,327
Let's have a consultation
right away today.

750
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,787
- Right. Of course.
- Okay.

751
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,289
Why don't we have you eat first?

752
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:44,252
I'll send someone over in three hours,
so come to my lab.

753
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:45,754
Thank you, Doctor.

754
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,174
- Right.
- Let's go.

755
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,426
Excuse me.

756
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:56,098
Has my grandmother arrived?

757
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,976
She has. Don't worry.

758
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,312
Let me see her, then.

759
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:08,526
Ms. Kim.

760
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,655
Haven't you explained it to her yet?

761
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,199
I'm sorry, sir.

762
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,619
Su-na.

763
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,041
Your grandmother's a lot sicker
than we expected,

764
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,544
so she'll need to be treated
for two to three days.

765
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,130
Is Grandma that unwell?

766
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,759
She just needs some rest.

767
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,928
You'll be able to see her in a day or so.

768
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,932
Dr. Yang Gi-su
is personally treating her, so don't...

769
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:43,270
I'm personally taking care of her,
so she will be a lot better.

770
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,064
So don't you worry about a thing. And…

771
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:47,565
She's Su-na.

772
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:51,236
Su-na, you're terribly malnourished
right now, okay?

773
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:54,072
So eat well and regain your health.

774
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,781
Here.

775
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:12,340
All right, enjoy your dinners.

776
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,636
And don't forget that you are our future.

777
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,711
- All right. Wrap it up.
- Yes, sir.

778
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:52,506
It's been over 20 hours.

779
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,050
Sergeants Choi and Oh haven't returned.

780
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,302
Further delays could be dangerous.

781
00:59:58,804 --> 00:59:59,971
It's fine. For now.

782
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:05,852
Maybe we should hand out personal syringes
for situations like this.

783
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:10,148
It's too dangerous
for an individual to carry yet.

784
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,777
Besides, there's no telling
what kind of side effects we'll see.

785
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,321
How long do we have to subsist
on these injections?

786
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,367
We're running out of children to bring.

787
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,662
We're almost there.

788
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,706
Just hang in there.

789
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:30,794
Get back to work now.

790
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,381
All they care about is themselves.

791
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,134
Human dignity? A thing of the past!

792
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:44,224
My research must see fruition
as soon as possible

793
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:47,519
so we can dream of a more meaningful life.

794
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:53,984
And when that day comes,
people will accept and value

795
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,945
the sacrifices of the evolutionary rejects
as necessities.

796
01:00:58,238 --> 01:00:59,781
That day will come, won't it?

797
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:37,652
It's time to change shifts.

798
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:50,248
Excuse me.

799
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:55,128
We applied for a meeting
with our child earlier.

800
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:56,796
Where can we meet her?

801
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,632
A meeting? What meeting?

802
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:02,636
The teacher said we could see our daughter
once our daily shift was over.

803
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,138
There's no such policy here.

804
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,182
She definitely told us earlier.

805
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:10,393
If Ju-ye can't visit here,
we'll go to her.

806
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:14,105
The eighth floor is off-limits
to regular residents. You can't go there.

807
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:16,316
Well, where's the teacher?

808
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,569
No, you know what? Where's my daughter?

809
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:22,322
What do you mean
we can't go see our child?

810
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,405
It was agreed!

811
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,243
- They can't see their kids.
- I hope ours are okay.

812
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,036
Don't mind us. Change shifts.

813
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:31,331
Let's talk tomorrow.

814
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,291
Hey, wait. Where is our daughter?

815
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,795
Where is she, you bastards?

816
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:04,990
How many times have I told you
not to interrupt while I'm experimenting?

817
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:07,492
Sorry, sir. Too many witnesses
made it hard to manage.

818
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,536
After all it took us to get these kids.

819
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:20,130
They're in the purification facility?

820
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:24,551
Sergeant Kang, please go upstairs
and prepare the drugs and catheter.

821
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,634
Yes, sir.

822
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,699
Fuck me, this is so embarrassing.

823
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,873
Let me see my daughter!

824
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,750
Why would you lie to us? Why?

825
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,544
The teacher told us
we could see her tonight!

826
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,795
Go check with her.

827
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:02,547
- Please calm down.
- Ask her.

828
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,382
Please let go. Where's the teacher?

829
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:06,217
Why do you keep lying to us?

830
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:07,635
What's all this, then?

831
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,471
What's going on here?

832
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,848
Doctor, where is Ju-ye?

833
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:15,727
You said we could see her!
You can't go back on something like that!

834
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,772
Sir, Ju-ye's doing fine.

835
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,231
She's doing great.

836
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:22,484
Doctor, please let us see Ju-ye.

837
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,236
Come on, don't be like this.

838
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,447
Please settle down.

839
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,285
Fine. Why don't we all go to my lab?

840
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,329
I'll let you see Ju-ye.

841
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,832
Let's go. Okay?

842
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,043
Let's go.

843
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,333
REPTILE REGENERATION EXPERIMENT

844
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,299
EXPERIMENTED ON FIVE SOLDIERS

845
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:37,892
SEVEN 10-YEAR-OLDS, ALL DEAD
FOUR 17-YEAR-OLDS, ALL DEAD

846
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:53,658
Ju-ye.

847
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:55,242
Ju-ye.

848
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:03,667
Come this way.

849
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,131
So, is our daughter here?

850
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,258
Why would…

851
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:13,344
See? Your daughter's fine.

852
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:16,055
- Ju-ye!
- Ju-ye!

853
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:18,433
Now, please don't stimulate Ju-ye!

854
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,268
It'll put her life at risk.

855
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,896
Ju-ye is a valuable asset
to our apartment,

856
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,856
performing her duties admirably.

857
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,233
Doctor, what is all this?

858
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,319
Is Ju-ye sick or something?

859
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,612
No, she's not sick.

860
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,323
Kids her age
have something special right here.

861
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,701
"Children are our hope."
You know our apartment's motto, right?

862
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:42,248
Now, look. This is my daughter.

863
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,626
Everyone said she was dead,
but I brought her back.

864
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:47,128
I've essentially created
an immortal human.

865
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:57,889
What?

866
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:03,603
The birth of a new humanity
rests on your daughter's shoulders.

867
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:07,398
Do you now understand the significant role
she plays in my research?

868
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:09,358
Ju-ye!

869
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:12,737
Hold on!
I told you not to stimulate your daughter!

870
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,657
I told you not to touch her!
For goodness' sake!

871
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,118
- What's wrong with Ju-ye?
- Jesus!

872
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:22,038
What's wrong with our daughter?!
What's wrong?!

873
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,040
- Ju-ye!
- I told you not to touch her!

874
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:28,545
Oh God, do something!

875
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:31,214
Do something!

876
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,552
What's wrong with her?!

877
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,136
What's wrong with Ju-ye?!

878
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:47,855
What's wrong with you, Ju-ye?

879
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:49,983
- Is our daughter dead?
- Wake up.

880
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:51,901
Ju-ye.

881
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:54,654
I was away for too long.

882
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,323
I told you not to interrupt!

883
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,158
- Ju-ye.
- Ju-ye?

884
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:00,493
Ju-ye!

885
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:01,953
- Look what happened.
- Ju-ye!

886
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:12,338
You have no idea
how important this research is, do you?

887
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,844
I fed you
and provided you with shelter, didn't I?

888
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:20,471
But you couldn't stand it?!

889
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,842
Send the cleanup crew to the lab.

890
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:10,313
Su-na, what are you doing here?

891
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:14,942
Great timing.

892
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:23,910
Thank you for coming with me.

893
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,539
I'm so grateful
to have met such good people.

894
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,125
I'm just here to bring Su-na back.

895
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:33,627
Besides,

896
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,506
he won't stop whining
without Su-na around.

897
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,177
I'm not a good person.

898
01:09:43,054 --> 01:09:44,972
There's a lot of blood on my hands.

899
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,103
Morning's here.

900
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:52,146
Get up, Ji-wan.

901
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:54,857
We're leaving already?

902
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:13,167
It must be nice to be so young.

903
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:17,422
The drugs work great on you,
and you don't even have side effects.

904
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,466
I know why you need all those children.

905
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,886
You're using us as lab rats
just so you can survive.

906
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:26,139
Don't worry.

907
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,474
I won't let you die so easily.

908
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:31,269
Our survival depends on children.

909
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:34,355
We sometimes encounter hiccups,
like with Ju-ye.

910
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,733
What the hell are you doing
to the kids' heads?

911
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:41,070
At your age, the pituitary glands
contain something vital to my research.

912
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:44,782
Of course, I need to tweak it a bit
before I can use it.

913
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:48,995
You know the water you drink
in the classroom? That does the trick.

914
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,329
Isn't it amazing

915
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:53,040
that we can achieve it
with just some drinking water?

916
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,419
What about my grandma?

917
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,340
You seriously believed
there was a medical facility?

918
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,595
The weak among us must be weeded out

919
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,930
for a new humanity to arise.

920
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:10,807
Stay still.

921
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:21,944
Hey, don't screw up.

922
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,237
Just trust me, sir.

923
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:31,204
- How've you been?
- What's with your face?

924
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:36,000
A few days ago, I got into a fight
with some crazy gorilla bastard.

925
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,211
What brings you here?

926
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,213
I came to deliver the goods.

927
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,757
I told you to only come on delivery days.

928
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:44,925
Damn it.

929
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:48,304
Well, you know, I was just passing by,

930
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:51,808
so I thought I'd make a delivery
and catch up with you.

931
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,477
Get that out of my face.

932
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,229
- Check the back.
- Yes, sir.

933
01:11:58,105 --> 01:11:59,106
Shut off the engine.

934
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:14,788
What's going on?

935
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:27,301
Hold tight, everyone!

936
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,934
Slow down!

937
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:38,395
No!

938
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:49,615
Hey, you son of a bitch!

939
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,642
Crazy bastard! You're mad!

940
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:26,193
Ji-wan!

941
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,202
We saw those people
when we went to pick Su-na up.

942
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:36,829
Inform the doctor.

943
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:37,913
Okay.

944
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,667
Sergeant Lee will go to the prison.

945
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,044
Don't follow her inside.

946
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,254
I've prepared a gift for her.

947
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,807
Move in, hurry!

948
01:14:01,896 --> 01:14:03,689
Please don't kill me. I'm sorry!

949
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:10,613
You don't have to shoot me too.

950
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:12,948
This way.

951
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,536
Fuck, thank God I didn't get shot.

952
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,415
Try to relax, Su-na.

953
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:26,837
What is it now?

954
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,172
Dr. Yang.

955
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:30,424
I'm sorry, but this is urgent.

956
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:34,845
Sergeant Lee is with two of the hunters
from Su-na's village.

957
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:37,306
I'm sure Sergeant Kwon
will take care of it.

958
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,191
I guess your friends are here
to see you, Su-na.

959
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,611
I doubt you'll see them.

960
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:11,048
- You sure it's this way?
- Yes, I'm sure.

961
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,431
Then why aren't they on our tail?

962
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:49,795
Guys, it's me. Are you all right?

963
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:53,841
San!

964
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:55,342
Hey!

965
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:57,969
Get up.

966
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,228
Your subordinates
don't seem too fond of us.

967
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,774
Hey, get a grip.

968
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,942
These things aren't human.

969
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:53,484
Snap out of it!

970
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:55,629
You guys still alive?

971
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:00,342
What were these monsters anyway?

972
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:03,637
The operation's a bust.

973
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:05,805
I'm sorry.

974
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:12,897
<i>To all residents of the apartment,
as you know, intruders are threatening</i>

975
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:16,066
the safety of our apartment
and its residents.

976
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,360
Please stay in your homes.

977
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:21,030
<i>Do not leave your homes
under any circumstances.</i>

978
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:22,615
<i>We've enhanced security</i>

979
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:26,994
<i>in the classrooms and student dorms,
so don't step outside no matter what.</i>

980
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:28,537
Lastly,

981
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:32,750
I'd like to inform our intruders
in the basement level,

982
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:36,170
<i>Sergeant Lee Eun-ho and the hunter person,</i>

983
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:39,590
<i>that you won't be able
to achieve your goals,</i>

984
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:41,175
so give up and leave now.

985
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,970
Then I'll spare your lives.

986
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:46,555
That fucking prick.

987
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:49,850
<i>I'm giving you one last chance.</i>

988
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:53,562
<i>There's an intercom in the basement.
Press the button and give me an answer.</i>

989
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,857
<i>If you'd like to walk away alive,
that's number one.</i>

990
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:59,860
Or if you'd like to be trapped forever
in the basement,

991
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:00,945
<i>that's number two!</i>

992
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,864
We pick one.

993
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:08,035
But we'll be taking Su-na.

994
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:14,959
Let's go get Su-na.

995
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:19,630
You're coming, right?

996
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:27,429
Sergeant Kwon.

997
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:30,808
Do not let them up to my room,
no matter what.

998
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:31,892
<i>I understand, sir.</i>

999
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,604
Team A, to the stairs,
and Team B, to the basement.

1000
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:38,732
I'll take the center.
Don't let them come up, no matter what.

1001
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:43,946
Pray that your friends
don't interrupt this experiment, okay?

1002
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,490
If you also end up dying,

1003
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,159
we have no one left to take your place.

1004
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:52,955
So, hang in there, okay?

1005
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,338
What do we do?

1006
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:02,756
We're almost out of ammo.

1007
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,865
Hey, grab their weapons.

1008
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:39,376
Go find Su-na. I'll handle things here.

1009
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,128
- Will you be okay?
- Just go.

1010
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:42,254
Be careful.

1011
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:00,481
Damn it.

1012
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,400
Where is it? Damn it.

1013
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:05,194
Hey, Ji-wan!

1014
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:06,839
What's going on?

1015
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:34,324
Let's go up.

1016
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:36,868
Keep up, Eun-ho!

1017
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:44,168
Keep going up.

1018
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:45,627
- What about you?
- Just go!

1019
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:14,990
Lee Eun-ho.

1020
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:20,913
Please don't kill us. We're just workers!

1021
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:27,711
I'm looking for a kid named Su-na.

1022
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:29,963
Where are the new kids?

1023
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,675
The children are all on the eighth floor.

1024
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:47,856
You guys should also hurry
and find your children.

1025
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,111
<i>Lee Eun-ho.</i>

1026
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:58,200
You're still too busy helping others
to find a way out for yourself.

1027
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:29,522
Su-na.

1028
01:24:30,524 --> 01:24:32,985
Don't shoot. Why are you doing this?

1029
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:42,743
Oh God, my knees.

1030
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:02,973
It's time for you to accept reality.

1031
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:05,017
The world we knew no longer exists.

1032
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:09,146
We should create a new world together.

1033
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,148
The world I want

1034
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,401
is one without people like you in it.

1035
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:31,001
So, Lee Eun-ho, you insist
on taking this to the very end.

1036
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:38,067
What is it?

1037
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:51,748
Where is Han Su-na?

1038
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,377
Where is she?!

1039
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:00,215
She's in the laboratory.

1040
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:04,428
Lead the way.

1041
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:12,185
You kids get out of here.
Don't you want to see your parents?

1042
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:20,652
- Hurry up.
- Hey.

1043
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,326
Take another step,
and I'll blow her brains out.

1044
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:32,497
Go ahead.
She won't live much longer anyway.

1045
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:35,375
Hey, Sergeant Kwon.
Have you lost your mind?

1046
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:37,461
Hey, soldier boy!

1047
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:40,130
Why aren't the elevators working here?

1048
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:43,800
Go. I'll take care of him.

1049
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:54,269
What's with this prick?

1050
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:57,731
Is that makeup on your face?

1051
01:27:58,815 --> 01:27:59,941
So, you're the hunter?

1052
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:01,651
What else would I be? A lover?

1053
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:03,903
Funny.

1054
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:06,156
I've been looking for you.

1055
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:08,867
Yeah. I'm in a rush. Let's make it quick.

1056
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,119
Daddy did it.

1057
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,085
You waited for too long, right?

1058
01:29:15,392 --> 01:29:16,392
Right.

1059
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:19,271
You monster.

1060
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:26,194
Do you really think

1061
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:30,657
this is the way to save your daughter?

1062
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:34,536
You truly are amazing, Su-na.

1063
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:37,247
Subjects usually take much longer
to wake up.

1064
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,418
It must be nice to be so young.

1065
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,337
My grandma told me…

1066
01:29:46,256 --> 01:29:47,340
that people…

1067
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:53,972
all reap what they sow.

1068
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:57,225
You're going to pay

1069
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,437
for everything you've done.

1070
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:06,650
Do you think…

1071
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,071
your daughter would accept

1072
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,699
what you've become?

1073
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:19,831
Want me to slice off your tongue?

1074
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:48,068
Tweaking the composition
was important, right?

1075
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:51,571
You know that strange water you gave me?

1076
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,783
I didn't drink any of it.

1077
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:56,242
Why you…

1078
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:05,293
Isn't it amazing

1079
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:09,297
that we can achieve something
to this effect?

1080
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:18,348
Oh God! Doctor!

1081
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:26,356
Don't come any closer.

1082
01:31:29,526 --> 01:31:30,526
Drop the gun.

1083
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:33,113
Drop it!

1084
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:36,825
Fuck.

1085
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:48,753
You crazy bastard.

1086
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:57,220
- Get So-yeon first.
- Sorry?

1087
01:31:58,388 --> 01:32:00,974
- I said get So-yeon ready first!
- Yes, sir.

1088
01:33:24,891 --> 01:33:26,643
Why won't you bastards just die?

1089
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:27,811
You can't kill me.

1090
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,910
Damn, that's one ugly mug.

1091
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,417
Kim Hak-yong!

1092
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:53,545
Hak-yong!

1093
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:55,839
- Oh my, Hak-yong.
- Are you all right?

1094
01:33:55,922 --> 01:33:58,967
What's wrong? What happened to you?

1095
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,344
Ji-wan!

1096
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:03,762
All right, let's go.

1097
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:05,640
Come on. Hurry.

1098
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:09,101
Oh no!

1099
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:18,444
Doctor.

1100
01:34:18,528 --> 01:34:21,197
Please save me.

1101
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:24,659
You said that you would save me. The shot.

1102
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:26,911
Where's the shot? The shot.

1103
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:29,205
You're going to die anyway.

1104
01:34:30,874 --> 01:34:33,585
No, don't do it. Please don't.

1105
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,551
Hey, you son of a bitch!

1106
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:50,727
What just happened up there?

1107
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:09,412
It's okay. You'll be fine.

1108
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:13,124
We can start all over again.
You trust your dad, right?

1109
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:17,669
What's going on?

1110
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:18,712
Hey, Ji-wan!

1111
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:28,555
Ji-wan!

1112
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:32,018
Hey! Wake up. Come on.

1113
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,229
Su-na.

1114
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:37,232
Su-na, are you all right?

1115
01:35:38,775 --> 01:35:39,775
Mister.

1116
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:42,070
Let's get out of here quickly.

1117
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:50,370
Those bastards.

1118
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:52,830
I told them to stay inside,
but they all crawled out.

1119
01:35:53,623 --> 01:35:54,623
Dr. Yang!

1120
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:55,959
It's Dr. Yang!

1121
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:58,086
Doctor, what just happened in there?

1122
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:00,964
Our child is still inside!

1123
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:03,675
Don't ask me! Get out of my way!

1124
01:36:05,093 --> 01:36:08,763
We did everything you told us to!
What have you done to our kids?!

1125
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,306
Let go of me!

1126
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:14,560
You've all been living in luxury
by mooching off your kids.

1127
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:17,438
- His face…
- Now you wanna act like good parents?

1128
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:29,200
So-yeon.

1129
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,038
Is everyone all right?

1130
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:35,665
- Yeah.
- What about Yang Gi-su?

1131
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:38,543
We might lose him if we move together.
You take the kids.

1132
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,168
Understood.

1133
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:42,546
Let's go.

1134
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:45,133
Be careful, mister.

1135
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,051
Hurry up and go.

1136
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:54,058
What's this?

1137
01:36:55,685 --> 01:36:56,685
So-yeon.

1138
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:01,399
Stop!

1139
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:06,112
He's a monster.

1140
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:18,041
You lowlife scum.

1141
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:24,797
Die!

1142
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:32,430
Die! All of you!

1143
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:33,973
Die!

1144
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:42,023
You all deserve to die!
I should kill every single one of you.

1145
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:43,900
Useless scum. Evolutionary rejects.

1146
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:46,527
Ready or not, here I come!

1147
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:59,207
So-yeon.

1148
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:05,963
So-yeon.

1149
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:08,049
It's okay, So-yeon.

1150
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:11,344
It's okay. Daddy will bring you back.

1151
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:16,974
It's okay.
You're going to be okay. I'm sorry.

1152
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:23,564
I'm so sorry.

1153
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:05,106
Yang Gi-su!

1154
01:39:15,283 --> 01:39:16,492
Don't come any closer!

1155
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:18,744
Not another step.

1156
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:21,080
I'm going to save my baby girl.

1157
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:23,875
Don't come any closer!

1158
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:30,798
That's enough, you monster!

1159
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:35,303
You were wrong.

1160
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:37,346
You couldn't save anyone.

1161
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:39,390
Not even your daughter.

1162
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:01,204
You people ruined everything.

1163
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:05,917
You people ruined it all.

1164
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:16,552
I wasn't wrong.

1165
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:19,847
You people ruined everything.

1166
01:40:21,098 --> 01:40:22,098
You people…

1167
01:40:23,768 --> 01:40:24,768
You people ruined...

1168
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,692
What will you do now?

1169
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:14,610
I'll start again right here.

1170
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:23,785
It's raining!

1171
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:25,413
It's raining!

1172
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:26,496
It's raining!

1173
01:41:27,873 --> 01:41:29,000
It's really raining.

1174
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:31,586
How long has it been?

1175
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:34,255
It's been so long since we had rain.

1176
01:41:40,303 --> 01:41:42,179
Let's go home now.

1177
01:41:43,389 --> 01:41:45,016
Right, let's go.

1178
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,768
God, that's refreshing!

1179
01:42:17,757 --> 01:42:19,550
Line up properly, everyone!

1180
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:23,804
- Step forward. Let's go.
- Su-na.

1181
01:42:28,351 --> 01:42:31,937
Su-na, white pigs like these
are really delicious, you know.

1182
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:36,400
That's…

1183
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:44,492
Good luck with her, mister.

1184
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:45,993
What do you mean, "good luck"?

1185
01:42:46,077 --> 01:42:48,496
- This way, Stepmom!
- What do you mean, "Stepmom"?

1186
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:52,500
Well, I don't drink.

1187
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:56,504
What's that ribbon she's wearing?

1188
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:59,340
- Move.
- Where are you going?

1189
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:01,300
I didn't survive to put up with this.

1190
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:28,257
ALL PEOPLE, EVENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, AND SETTINGS

1191
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:30,926
IN THE FILM ARE FICTIONAL
