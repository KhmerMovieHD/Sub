Stop right now.

Just let So-yeon go.

00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,994
I have to revive her.

00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,455
She'll be dead if we don't act now.

25

- Don't make me shoot.
- Gi-su, wait.

You've taken over a hundred lives
with these horrific experiments.

This isn't what So-yeon would have wanted.

28
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,301
Your daughter's not going to come back.
Let her go.

29
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:59,179
I can't.
I've finally got it figured it out now.

I swear, I know. Look at me.

Grandma, I told you to let me know
if you needed me to do anything.

00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,285
I'm fine, Su-na.

90
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,705
I just stepped outside
to get a little fresh air.

you know your knees need rest.

Oh God.

00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,140
There really isn't any drinkable water,
is there?

97
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,396
Maybe we should… find ourselves a car

98
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,024
and go live in the Bus District.
What do you think, Su-na?

99

Well, um,

100
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,197
I think I'd rather live
right here with you.

101
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,119
Just because there are more people there
doesn't mean it's safer.

102
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,122
There was that time
the cannibals tried taking us.

103
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,917
They used to be kind before the drought,
and now it's just different.

104
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,880
You know, not everybody in the world
is evil like that.

105
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:12,761
[inhales deeply] Well, most people
that I've seen are like that though.

Listen, this is what I think, okay?

109
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,147
In this life, it's best to believe
that you reap whatever you sow.

110
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,610
It might seem like everyone's evil,
but if you embrace the good in the world,

111
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,279
you're going to find people that are kind.

112
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,448
That, I'm sure of.

113
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,326
Grandma, you trust too much.

114
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,496
I'm sure before the earthquake
that was true.

115

[inhales deeply]

116
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,082
I guess you're right.

117
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,751
But I don't remember what that was like.

118

Oh, that's right.

121
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,674
We're going to
the Bus District today, actually.

122
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,803

[man] I've had enough
of all this dirty water.

125
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,852
We haven't gotten a drop of rain
for how many months now?

126
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,522
[woman] This is nothing.

127
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,899
Last year, we had a drought
for over six months.

128
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,587
Hey! Hey!

129
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,755
We've got meat here!

130
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:31,839
Hurry up!

131
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,467
Alright, alright, line up everyone,
right here!

132
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,136
Have your bartering pieces ready to go.

133
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,428
Hey, sir!

134
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,472
It's… it's a single-file line.

135

[indistinct chatter, laughter]

136

Alright.

Rubber boots.

138
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,897

- Fine, whatever.

[sighs]

140
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,692
Next.

141
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,612
[Nam San] Oh, no, no.

142
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,739
- No, thanks.
- [man] Looks fine to me.

[sighs]

144
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,663
Alright. Here.

145
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,750
Ah! My God!

146
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:16,967
[chuckles]

147
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,471
This should be enough

148
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,391
to get that section.

149
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,185
The entire tail.

150
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,687
The whole thing.

151
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,356
Yeah, but you can't eat that. No, thanks.

152
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,904
Once this situation dies down and things
start to get better, this will all be...

153
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,531
Oh wow.
You're really optimistic, lady. Hmm?

154
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,036
I mean, it's been over three years
since the whole world ended.

155
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,746
It's about time you accept it.

156
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,790
[Nam San] Hey, here, at least take this.
Here you go. Here.

157
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,544
We really shouldn't be doing this,
but no one's looking.

158
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,754
[hissing]

159
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,671
Do I cook it?

160
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,632
It's poisonous. You better.

00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,216
[chuckles]

162
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,604
[Nam San] What's this?

163
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,687
- Rice.
- Rice?

164
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,567
[woman] Oh, thank you.

165
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,111

00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,949
- Hello, how are you?
- Oh, there you are, Su-na. How's it going?

168
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:21,866
Hello.

169
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,160
Ah, man, you didn't have to come
all the way out here.

170
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,162
I could have just stopped by
on my way home.

171
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,499
- She must be exhausted.
- Oh, cut it out. We need to eat, don't we?

172
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,669
Anyway, Su-na owes her life
to Nam San, after all.

173
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,880
I can't believe that was three years ago.

174
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:39,550
I feel bad. You've given us
your hospitality for so long. Here.

175
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,262
You didn't have to. Thank you so much.

176
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,099
Su-na has grown into a fine young woman.

177
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,475
Ah, thanks a lot.

178
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,353
Right. Well, uh, take some meat.

179
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,729
- This here.
- Su-na.

180
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,856
I caught this crocodile, you know.

181
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,693
Mm-hmm? Nam San didn't catch this one?

182
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,528
Hey, seriously? Huh?

183
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,073
[Su-na] I wanted to trade this in.

184
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,702
[chuckles] Oh, I'm guessing
you painted this. Let's see it.

185
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,412
Wow…

186
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,789
Masterpiece. It's amazing.

187
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,000
- An original?
- Yes.

188
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,585
Have one for me?
I'm out there hunting too, right?

189
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,588
Oh, we should head out now.
There are people behind us waiting.

190
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,257
- Mm.
- Sorry about that.

191
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,676
- We'll get going now.
- Goodbye. See you soon.

192
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,177
- We'll be on our way now.
- See ya.

193
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,095
Next.

194
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,221
[sirens wailing]

[sighs contentedly]

201
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,661
They practically set up
a fucking village here, huh?

202
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,330
Living hard, I see. Damn!

203
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,540
[laughs, blows into bullhorn]

204
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,750
Alright, listen.

205
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,877
Bus District folks, listen up.

206
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,840
All of us are from the, uh,
the Jamsil Police Station, okay?

207
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,176
Huh? Here's the proof right here.
Take a look.

208
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,430
Uh, so long as you guys cooperate with us,

209
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,973
nobody will get hurt.

210
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:09,891
Okay?

211
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:10,974
[villagers murmuring]

212
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,187
Fuck me, just say something.

213
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,397
Uh, well, as to why we're here, then,

214
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,316
uh, here it is. Here we go.

215
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,986
We are bounty hunters
searching for a notorious villain.

216
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,863
We've been on his trail and…

217
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,781
WANTED

218
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,241
…found that this neighborhood
reeks of his scent.

219
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:31,120
So I'd like to ask everybody
for your cooperation right now. Huh?

220
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,830
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

221
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,374
Yeah. That guy looks just like him.

222
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,584
- See that?
- Oh, he does!

223
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,794
Alright, take him away.

224
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,462
- Oh God!
- [yells]

225
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,006
[man grunts] It's not me!

226
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,511
Hey, hey, hey, grab that woman
who's wearing all the gold.

227
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,472
[man laughs]

228
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,265
Hey!

229
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,059
I'm a lady though. Wait.

230
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,062
Yeah, I know. Uh, this guy <i>is </i>a lady.

231
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,397
[laughs] He's a lady?

232
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,314
Oh!

233
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,732
[concerned chatter]

234
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,150
Hey, hey, you, you, you.

235
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:04,778
Let's go.

236
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,697
Hey, let me go.

237
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,159
[chuckles] Strong guy, eh?

238
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,661
- You fuck.
- [villagers gasp]

239
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,996
Are you even a real cop?

240

[man 2] Oh jeez…

243
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,423
We warned you.
Cooperate, or you'll get hurt.

244
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,426
[cackles]

245
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,887
[gang leader] Whoa!

246
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,348
Wow!

247
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,434
How old are you?

248
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,353
[Su-na] What's it matter to you?

249
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,355
I'm just glad to see you.

250
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,108
Everybody your age has
basically disappeared, that's all.

251
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,943
You smell awful. Stay away.

252
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,155
- Come on, Grandma.
- Let's go, let's go.

253
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,116
Ah, this bitch. Come here! [grunts]

254
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,118
- That son of a…
- [gang leader] What did you say?

255
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,786
Hey, you, get off her…

256
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,539
- You old hag!
- You son of a bitch!

257
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,293
Su-na, are you alright?

258
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,752
[man yells]

259

you little bastard!

Hey, hold it.

263
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,483
Go.

264
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,818
Move.

[gang leader panting]

275
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,320
So are you in charge, then?

276
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,822
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't even know who the boss is.

277
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,074
Come on. Just say who it is.

Uh, T… T… T…

279

Tiger. Tiger's my boss.

Tiger? So he's still alive, huh?

281
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,670
Hey, where'd you get this water?

282
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,339
- A… at an apartment. An apartment.
- An apartment?

283
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,466
- Yes, sir.
- I've spent a lot of time around here.

284
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,870
Never come across any apartments.

285
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,135
It's the truth.

286
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,596
I… it's just far from here
and surrounded by tall trees,

287
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,601
so it can just be hard to see, yeah.
There's clean water at that apartment.

288
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:44,272
Listen, if you come here again,
I'm going to have to kill you, okay?

289
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,815
Yes, yes, of course.

290
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,358
And Tiger should know that.

291
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,441
Yes.

292
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,069
[grunts]

293
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,740
Okay, what should…
wh… who should I say said that?

[sighs]

295
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,535
Nam San.

Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah…

298
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,584
Understood. Hey, hey. Go, get up, go.

So sorry, I'm sorry.

[man] You alright?

303
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,928
You alright? You okay?

304
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,638
Oh, yes, yes. Are you?

305
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,600
- I think so.

Nam San.

309
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,754
[man] By the way, all that talk earlier
might not have been complete nonsense.

310
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,338
What talk?

311
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,385
Remember? They said there's an apartment
where you can get clean water.

312
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,305
I heard it really exists.

313
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,058
And people are dying to get over there.

314
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,935
I heard there's a ton of residents,

315
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,396
and that it's heaven on earth. [chuckles]

316
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,817
How about you go check it out?

317
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,611
I mean, I'm just curious about it.

318
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,448
And besides,
you don't get to just go there.

Who are you all?

[grandmother] Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

They're not bad people.

It's okay, Nam San.

328
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:45,684
What kind of teacher?

329
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,062
Hello, gentlemen. Nice to meet you.

330
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,691
We actually have started
a safe haven in Seoul.

331
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,235
I'm the leader of our organization's
volunteer group, and…

332
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,238
[whispers] I think that's the same place
I mentioned before.

333
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,740
But, uh, why us though?

334
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,034
Uh, you see,

335
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:06,038
we're prioritizing the safety
of families with children below 20.

336
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,834
We believe that protecting our youth
is the only way to save humanity.

337
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,335
Su-na, if you come with us,

338
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,630
your grandmother will live comfortably
for the rest of her life.

339
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,050
We have clean water
and plenty of food in storage.

340
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,802
You have clean water?

341
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,138
Oh my God, that's incredible.

342
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,725
If that place is so amazing,
then it's gonna be a target for the gangs.

343
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,393
You ever stop to consider that?

344
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,477
[laughs]

345
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:33,399
There's a security force
of armed ex-military soldiers,

346
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,610
which means that the gangs
couldn't possibly make a move on us.

347
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,780
Well, in that case,
can the two of them come with us?

348
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,282
They're like family to me.

349
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,199
[Teacher] I'm sorry.

350
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,662
We can only take
direct family members right now.

351
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,001
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but I need your answer soon.

352
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:52,918
For Su-na's sake,

353
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,755
I hope that you're going to make
the right choice here.

354
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,717
And unfortunately, we're going to have to
find someone else if you say no.

355
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,261
The thing is, ma'am,
my grandmother is not well,

356
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,638
and she won't be able to walk
that whole way.

357
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,141
We have medical staff
standing by at the halfway point

358
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,311
to ensure everyone on our watch
arrives safely. Don't worry.

359
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,688
She's right. Su-na, we should go.

360
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,774
You should go.
It has to be better than this.

361
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,193
Right. You deserve that.

362
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,616
I'll come visit you.

363
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,537
[Su-na] Okay.

364
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,997
You too, Nam San.

365
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,624
Will you also visit us?

366
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,209
I will, I promise.

367
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,128
Just a second, Grandma.

368
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,507
Thank you so much

369
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,426
for all your help and support, Nam San.

370
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,762
Don't mention it. Take care of yourself.

371
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,306
Safe travels.

372
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,444
[Su-na] It's, uh, just a practice sketch.

373
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,029
- [sentimental music playing]
- Oh wow!

374
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,078
We should hurry along now.
It'll be harder to walk after sundown.

375
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,248
- Oh, um, Grandma, come on.
- Okay.

376
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,969
[chuckles]

377
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,143
When'd she get a good-enough look
to draw me like this? [chuckles]

378
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,104
[sighs]

379
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,901
Hyung, Su-na has a crush on me,
don't you think?

380
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,403
Hmm, nah, I don't think so.

381
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,615
Man, what am I gonna do

382
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,409
now that Su-na's gone?

383
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,120
This place is way too dangerous
for her to live in.

384
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,540
Things like what happened today
happen too often.

385
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,419
I mean, you could just keep her safe,
like how you did today.

386
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,339
[sighs] How would I do that?

387
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,425
I couldn't even protect my own daughter.

388
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,885
Sheesh, man!

389
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,179
Look, there you go again
with that kind of talk.

390
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,725
[Nam San sighs]

391
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,772
[man] But Su-na sure does look
a lot like your daughter.

392
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:22,902
Oh!

393
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,571
If you got married and adopted me,

394
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,573
wouldn't that mean
we could also live there?

395
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,574
- Huh?
- [sighs]

396
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,451
What do you think about the jewelry girl?

397
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,369
- Hey.
- Seriously.

398
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:35,205
I know the world might have ended,
but I still have standards.

399
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,792
- You just want me to be alone forever.
- [scoffs]

400
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,669
You know how couples
take after each other?

401
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:44,173
You're pretty similar. And that complexion
would look great with the right makeup.

402
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,383
Hey, she stuffed that snake in her nose.

403
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,468
Who does that?

404
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,469
That's enough.

405
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,553
Okay? Enough.

406
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,015
[Nam San sighs wearily]

407
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,435
Where you going?

408
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,731
Ugh, you're running your mouth too much,
so I'm getting some air.

409
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,232
Going on a night hunt?

410
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,151
- That's right.
- Let me come with you.

411
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,079
Grandma, are you alright?

412
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,246
Uh-huh.

413
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,792
- Yes, dear, don't you worry about me.
- Watch your step here.

414
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,960
[ominous music playing]

415
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,433
[Teacher exhales]

416
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,647
Oh, don't worry.
They're part of our volunteer group.

417
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,398
Okay.

418
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,003
These are
the Western Region families joining us.

419
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,421
Oh, thank you.

420
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,881
Thank you for making it
all the way out here, everyone.

421
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,091
It's a pleasure.

422
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,302
Now follow me this way,
please, and be careful.

423
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,937
[woman] Um…

424
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:24,857
I'm Lee Ju-ye.

425
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,442
I'm 18. And you?

426
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,320
Uh, Han Su-na.

427
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:31,989
And I'm also 18.

428
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,407
Oh. Wanna be friends?

429
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,243
Yeah, sure.

430
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,326
We're friends now.

431
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,581
I haven't had a friend
who's my age in forever.

432
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,999
Yeah, me too.

433
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,210
There was nobody my age
in my neighborhood either.

434
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,337
And where were you living?

435
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:51,800
I lived in a tent near the Bus District.
I've been staying with my grandma here.

436
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,469
- [grandmother chuckles]
- [Ju-ye] Oh.

437
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,137
Nice to meet you, Ju-ye.

438
00:25:56,346 --> 00:26:00,225
My mom and dad made us live underground
'cause it wasn't safe outside.

439
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,853
I'm sure that was hard.

440
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,397
It wasn't so bad, actually.

441
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,902
But the bugs and rats
would crawl all over my body.

442
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,822
So I had to keep moving
my arms and legs, you know,

443
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,116
so they didn't bite down,
thinking I was dead.

444
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,576
That part was pretty rough.

445
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,706
At least that stuff is all over now.

446
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,250
[Ju-ye] Mm-hmm.
I heard the place is amazing.

447
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,694
First thing I'm gonna do
when we get there is take a shower.

448
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,506
It still feels like the bugs are
clinging to my skin right now.

449
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:35,928
[wolf howls]

450
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,807
[man] I wonder
if Su-na's made it there by now.

451
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,392
God, I wish I could go there with her.

452
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:48,023
[sighs] Man, I really don't wanna
have to let her go.

453
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,400
You know we can go see her
when we visit, right?

454
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,485
No.

455
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:53,570
The jewelry woman.

456
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,824
I always wanted that kind of mother.

457
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,410
- Alright, you little… Come here!
- Hey, okay, I get it!

458
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,371
[Su-na] Careful.

459
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,707
[grandmother groaning]

460
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,042
Oh God! Oh my…

461
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,378
Oh my God! Grandma, are you okay?

462
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,296
[grandmother] Oh God.

463
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,215
Let's stop here, okay?

464
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,553
Why don't we escort Su-na's grandmother
and your grandfather

465
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,305
to the medical station
I mentioned earlier on?

466
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,724
It's dangerous terrain
from this point forward,

467
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,144
and we wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.

468
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,272
Mr. Oh and Mr. Choi
will safely escort you there.

469
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,107
Thank you so much.

470
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,693
Yes, thank you
for everything you're doing.

471
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,777
Ma'am,

472
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,738
just please take care of my grandma, okay?

473
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:39,116
Of course. We'll take care of her.

474
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,370
- Mr. Choi.
- I'll look after your grandma.

475
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,067
- [Mr. Oh] Please come with me, sir.
- [man] Thank you so much.

476
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,422
- [woman] Slowly.
- [man] I-I'll see you tomorrow, Dad.

477
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,900
- [woman] Careful, sweetheart.
- [man] I hope he'll be alright.

478
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,843
[Teacher] Alright,
let's move on now, then.

479
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,933
Su-na, you just keep going. It'll be okay.

480
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,602
[unsettling music playing]

481
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:21,325
- Oh sh… shit. Shit.
- Freaking out again.

482
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,451
Looks like a bust.

483
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,660
Let's check the snare.

484
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,412
[man breathing deeply]

485
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,495
[man] Okay.

486
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,582
- [Nam San sighs]
- [man exhales]

[unsettling music playing]

489
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,597
These vehicles belong to us.
Everyone get in,

490
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,183
and we'll get off our feet
for the rest of the way.

491
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,935
[Su-na] Excuse me.

492
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,314
If the cars were here, then Grandma
could have just come with all of us.

493
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,941
Okay, we'll wait, then.

494
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,903
What's a few more hours of waiting
when everyone's been walking all night?

495
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,739
Isn't that right, everyone?

496
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,699
- Ma.
- Huh?

497
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:05,160
- I'm thirsty.
- We don't have any water right now.

498
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,703
Hang in there, okay?

499
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,624
Oh, what do we do?

500
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,417
Su-na,

501
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,170
we'll send a car
for your grandmother tomorrow.

502
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,463
Don't worry about her.

503
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,132
Let's get going now.

504
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
Get in, everyone.

505
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,307
- [woman] Oh God, thank you.
- [Teacher] Oh my, you must be exhausted.

506
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,190
Don't worry about your grandma too much.
I'm sure she's okay.

507
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,359
- [Su-na] Mm.
- We need to do a head count.

508
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,784
[grandmother panting]

509
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,749
[man] To think there's still people doing
such fine work in these trying times…

510
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:56,378
Yes, he's right.
I feel bad you're going out of your way.

511
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,754
Oh, don't mention it.

512
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,590
Alright, it's time to stop now.

513
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,261
[ominous music playing]

514
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:14,146
I don't see the facility anywhere though.

515
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,730
[Mr. Oh] Down there.

516
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,859
- [thud]
- [gasps]

517
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,486
[man] Huh?

518
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:23,739
Is that Grandma?

519
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,533
Grandma!

520
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:32,080
[tense music playing]

521
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,095
Grandma! Wake up, Grandma!

What's with these freaks?

[panting]

527
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,061
[man] What the hell?

528
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,662
Let's go, you asshole.

529
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:02,962
Why did you kill her?

530
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,258
- They were both useless.
- You fucking son of a bitch!

531
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,341
Oh my God…

532
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,093
Su-na…

533
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,011
Where is Su-na?!

534
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,640

[man] Fucking die!

[yells furiously]

538
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,965
[Nam San] Ji-wan!

539
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,887
Who are you?

540

[breathing heavily]

543
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,570
Hyung, we have to go right now.
Su-na's in danger.

544
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:13,617
Not yet. We have to pay our respects.
Are you just gonna leave her like that?

545
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,910
[Ji-wan inhales deeply]

We're almost there, everyone.

551
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,901
Please gather your personal items.

552

[metal creaking]

00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,538
You came here to see me?

555
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,790
[woman] That's right.

556
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,417
I need your help, Nam San.

557
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,629
I need to rescue my associates
and the residents of the apartment.

558
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,691
All right, so my question is, why'd
you come to us, of all people, for help?

559
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,051
And who the hell were those guys?
And the apartment?

560
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,928
Hey. Mind your business.

561
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,179
[grunts angrily]

562
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,263
I really need you.

563
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,223
[Nam San] I've never seen
anything like this before.

564
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,770
You need to chop their heads off?

565
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:24,896
[woman] Exactly.

566
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:28,984
What are they anyway?

567
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,319
[unsettling music playing]

568
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,322
[woman] <i>My name is Lee Eun-ho.</i>

569
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,117
<i>I used to be
an air force sergeant, special ops.</i>

570
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,888
We're going down to look for survivors.

571
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,372
[both] Yes, Sergeant.

572
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,880
[Eun-ho] <i>We were watching everything</i>
<i>from the sky</i>

<i>During our search for survivors,</i>

575
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,139
<i>we came across an apartment
that somehow hadn't crumbled down.</i>

576
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,434
<i>So our unit struck an aquifer there,</i>

577
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,937
<i>and with the survivors,
we did everything in our power</i>

578
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,647
<i>to get the apartment up and running.</i>

579

<i>But then one day,</i>

581

<i>Yang Gi-su.</i>

582
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,284
<i>The only doctor we'd seen
since the tragedy.</i>

583
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,662
<i>Being a doctor,
he was invaluable to our cause.</i>

584
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,999
- <i>But one day, he showed his true colors.</i>
- [door opens]

585
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:32,547
Dr. Yang, I wanted to check on something.
Some parents have been complaining

586
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,925
that their children have yet to return
ever since they came to see you.

587
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,010
What have you done?

588
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,095
- [Gi-su sighs]
- [door opens]

589
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,306
[man] Lee Eun-ho, what's going on?

590
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,350
Well, explain yourself.

591
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,517
Sergeant Kwon,

592
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:49,606
don't you think it's time
we let Sergeant Eun-ho in on our secret?

593
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,231
[Kwon] Eun-ho,

594
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,109
the world as we know it is doomed.

595
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:54,486
[ominous music playing]

596
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,695
We need to…

597
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,407
place all our faith in Dr. Yang.

598
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,701
[Gi-su] I merely gave him some advice.

599
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,870
I also gave him a little gift as well.

600
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,625
- [menacing music playing]
- [breathing anxiously]

601
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,922
- Why did you kill him?
- [Kwon] Look.

602
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,349
This is the breakthrough
we were waiting for.

603
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,260
- [hissing]
- [flesh stretching]

605
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,401
[Gi-su] Sergeant Lee Eun-ho?

606
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,111
Think about it.

607
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,737
Take a good look at me.

608
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,364
How…

609
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,826
how do you think I was able to survive
that horrible earthquake?

610
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,247
I once went two, three months or so
without having any water.

611
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,166
This is the future of mankind.

612
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,795
This apartment won't last long,
and everyone's doomed.

613
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,339
Failure to embrace this change
will kill everyone.

614
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,301
And I'll help you all survive.

615
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,679
No, you're insane.

616
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,473
- Where are the children?
- Get her out.

617
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,308
- What have you done with them?
- Now, now.

618
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,729
Wait! Let me go!

619
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,899
[Kwon] Shit!

620
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,069
Lee Eun-ho!

621
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,830
It seems Yang Gi-su has been conducting
strange experiments on humans.

622
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,459
They've become those creatures
because of what he's doing.

623
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,335
- If you help me, then...
- Hey.

624
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:35,836
Listen.

625
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,797
Su-na is all I care about.

626
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:42,510
And I'm gonna kill you
if you even try anything.

627
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,094
Got it?

628
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,439
[travelers gasp]

629
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,983
[Teacher] We have over 30 families
living here right now,

630
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,067
and we even provide our residents
with electricity,

631
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,863
thanks to the new solar panels
that we installed.

632
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,786
[girl] Are we going to live here?

633
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,082
Is that lettuce? I even see some tomatoes.

634
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,297
WELCOME, NEW RESIDENTS

635
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,174
WELCOME TO THE NEW FUTURE OF HUMANITY

636
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,802
[Teacher] Make way, make way!

637
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,390
Dr. Yang is about to come out now.

638
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,272
Hello, everyone.

639
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,149
I'm in charge of this place.

640
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,943
Yang Gi-su, nice to meet you.

641
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,278
[cheering]

642
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,781
Welcome, everyone.

643
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:50,870
You all must have
gone through terrible things out there,

644
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,373
where the world is brutal and unsafe.

645
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,542
You've all had to endure
the worst out there,

646
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,585
where the barbarians roam free.

647
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,671
But now… now you don't have to worry.

648
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,673
We will be, uh, providing you

649
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,801
with clean water
and provisions, of course.

650
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,930
And we'll keep you all safe
from the outside world.

651
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,308
Right, get some water for them
if you would.

652
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,772
That's clean water

653
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,774
that we purified ourselves
in this apartment.

654
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,484
Yeah.

655
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,947
Uh, wait, sir.

656
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,492
My grandma is gonna be arriving soon.
Can I please have another water?

657
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:32,703
Thanks so much.

658
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,872
They've been mercilessly taking children,
just like they took Su-na.

659
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,874
Can you imagine
what he must be doing to them?

660
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,293
Those sons of bitches! Oh shit!

661
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,586
We have to go right now.

662
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,047
- Su-na's in danger!
- Do you have a death wish or something?

663
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,591
Charging in won't do us any good.

664
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,970
Security is much tighter
than you might expect.

665
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,139
They've been shooting
everybody who trespasses.

666
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,726
I'll kick things off by taking care
of all the guards at the main gate

667
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,020
and keeping them distracted come daybreak.

668
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,105
If the two of you
get to the underground prison

669
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,607
and rescue my associates,

670
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,652
they'll be able to help us.

671
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:49,197
Hey, why should we believe
your associates or whatever?

672
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,825
Ugh, so disrespectful,
running your mouth again.

673
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,494
How old are you?

674
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,537
I'm 18, fuck you very much, lady.

675
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,741
You better watch your mouth.

676
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:01,793
- Let go!
- Hey, calm down, you little lovebirds.

677
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:03,962
Let's think this over.

678

00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,310
Amen, yeah.

- [indistinct yelling]
- [cackles]

683

- [man] Hey, hey!
- [cackles]

684
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,901
[gang leader] Sir,
I took care of all of them.

685
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,567
- [man 1] Go at it, you stupid idiot!
- [man 2] Fight!

686
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,406
- [man 3] Hurry up and fight!
- Hey, hey!

687
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,949
- Come on!
- Hey.

688
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,659
[man 5] Get 'em out of there!

689
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,536
[indistinct yelling]

690
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,330
Come on, bro. Wanna see
your wife's blood spurt everywhere?

691
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,248
[man 6] Do something!

692
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,249
[yells]

693
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,792
[cheering]

694
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,085
Let's go, let's go!

695
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,895
[man 6] Oh shit!

696
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,105
[laughing]

697
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,441
- [man 6] Bitch!
- Shit, man, we lost again?!

698
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,525
[laughing]

699
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,947
Hey, Pung-gi.

700
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,783
Have anything left to bet?

701
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,453
You limp-dick,
chrome-dome, lard-ass shithead,

702
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,288
can't you see there's one left?

703
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,873

[Pung-gi chuckling]

706
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,758
Wow, to think in prison, I saved your life

707
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,135
just so you could disrespect me.

708
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,054
- You show some respect.
- Fuck them up!

709
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,060
Come here!

710
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,355
Fuck!

711
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:48,732
[man] Tiger!

712
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,109
What, asshole?

713
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:53,654
- [stabbing]
- Damn it!

714
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,491
Hey, fucking kill them all!

715
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,373
[crow calling]

716
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:13,758
Alright, wait!

717
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,970
Tiger around here?

718
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,590
[Tiger] Well, look who it is.

719
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,142
Nam San, it's been a while.

720
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,561
Oh, there's the potato face I remember.

721
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:29,065
Sir, that's the asshole.
Watch out. He's a beast.

722
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,902
Thanks to you,
my boxing career ended, and I got screwed.

723
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:36,364
I've been itching for revenge,
and you just walked right into your grave.

724
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,075
Hey, I came here to ask you a question.

725
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,077
I changed my mind after that tone.

726
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,122
- Should I beat your ass now?
- There's no ring around here.

727
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,416
Street fighting's way out of your league,
you ass!

728
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,627
Hey, Pung-gi.

729
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:53,631
If you bring down that gorilla,
I'll give you half the slaves.

730
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:54,714
Half?

731
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,136
After I kill him,
you're next, you fat loser.

732
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,346
Now kill that man!

733
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,430

Damn it! Ugh, it hurts!

742
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:19,508
- Oh God, it hurts!
- Get up. Come on.

00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,135
Hey, let's go!

Wait!

Hello, how are you?

750
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,912
Uh, can you tell me
when my grandma will be arriving?

751
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:48,995
Your grandma?

752
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,957
What do you mean?

753
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,251
We sent a car for them earlier today,

754
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,544
so she should be here at dinner.

755
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,673
Don't worry about it. Enjoy the sunshine.

756
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:00,966
Okay.

757
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:02,676
[chuckles]

758
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:06,055
[sighs] You sure are doing a lot
to please a child.

759
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,599
Children are the pathway to our future.

760
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,435
We have to keep them content.

761
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,231
Our real future is through Dr. Yang Gi-su.

762
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,148
Okay?

763

[optimistic string music playing]

765
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,159
Today we're going to be announcing
the cumulative scores.

766
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,746
In first,

767
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,332
Kim Hak-yong.

768
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:37,295
- [both exclaiming excitedly]
- Unit 604. Lee Gyu-yeon, unit 607.

769
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,755
Third place, Choi Ju-yeong, unit 601.

770
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,091
Fourth place, Jang Chang-su, unit 608.

771
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,801
Uh, ex… excuse me?

772
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,179
What grades is he talking about?
We're new here, so we don't know.

773
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,890
Whichever student gets the highest score,

774
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:53,060
they get to choose a unit
to live in with their family.

775
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,229
I'm so jealous of you.

776
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,190
My child places last every week.

777
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:00,401
Family members of the student
with the highest score

778
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,279
will be exempt from work
and also given a free meal pass.

779
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,240
Family members of Kim Hak-yong,
please step forward.

780
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,909
[Gi-su clears throat]

781
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,787
- Congratulations. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

782
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,623
- Thank you, Doctor.
- [crowd applauds]

783
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,460
Do you think
that you can score the highest?

784
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,794
Of course!

785
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,547
[Gi-su] The children are our hope!

786
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,966
The children are our future!

787
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,177
Everyone, please keep
your children strong,

788
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,678
and let's lift them all up!

789
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:30,264
[applause]

790
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,231
Alright, everybody.
It's time to say your goodbyes.

791
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,568
As we mentioned before, all the students
will be living on the eighth floor.

792
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,195
- [man] Huh?
- [Su-na] What?

793
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,072
You never mentioned that though.

794
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,407
Your grandmother has been told
all of this.

795
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,576
Maybe she forgot to say something to you?

796
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,202
Oh…

797
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,373
Does that mean that I won't live with her?

798
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,458
Will we have
any contact with Ju-ye at all?

799
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:01,837
I'll make sure you'll be able to see her
if you just schedule a meeting.

800
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,964
So we just need to make
an appointment with you?

801
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:04,965
Of course.

802
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,300
[relieved sighs]

803
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,594
I'll get going now.
I'll score high for you.

804
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,096
Don't skip any meals, okay?

805
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,764
- [Ju-ye giggles]
- Okay, let's go.

806
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:15,267
- Please take good care of her.
- Right, take good care of her.

807
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:17,812
- See you later!
- As for the parents, please follow me.

808
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,523
- Gyu-rin, listen to your older brother.
- Okay.

809
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,109
- Han Seong-won, take good care of Gyu-rin.
- I will.

810
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:24,527
- Okay? Bye.
- This way.

811
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,153
[Gyu-rin] Is this all I need to take?

812
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,087
[whirring]

813
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,681
[officer] This is the clean water
that our children drink.

814
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,393
Now, if you look here,
you'll see the steps we take

815
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,896
to filter the dirty water
and produce the potable water we drink.

816
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,773
The most precious resource we have.

817
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:09,864
Hyung!

818
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,157
They have guns here.

819
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:12,824
Okay.

820
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:18,038
Hey, I'm just curious.
Where'd you get the guns and the water?

821
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,915
The apartment, is that right, guys?

822
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,500
Huh?

823
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:22,584
[mouths]

824
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,253
You don't know?

825
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,171
Uh, do… do we…

826
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:26,589
do… do we know where we got it?

827
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,672
What?

828
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,134
Do you know or not?

829
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,136
Uh, I'm not… I'm not entirely sure.

830
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,679
Okay, take a nap, then.

831
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,558
[intriguing music playing]

832
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,559
Do you know?

833
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,643
I don't exactly...

834
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:40,936
Lights out.

835
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,647
You? You don't know?

836
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:44,731
No.

837
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,566
What about you?

838
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:47,776
- Uh…
- You don't know.

839
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:52,323
- What about you? Do you know? No?
- [chuckling nervously]

840
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,491
You don't, do you?

841
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,501
- Uh, you don't know about this.
- I do know, sir.

842
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,916
- Nope, no way.
- I go out to make these deals.

843
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,293
You're gonna need me around
to help you, Nam San.

844
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,266
Hey there.

845
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,311
Do you come down here every day to work?

846
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,440
Yeah, this is our daily work.

847
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,784
They have a monopoly on all the water.

848
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,494
We're talking really clean shit.

849
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,204
They just hoard it for themselves?

850
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,206
That gives them their authority.

851
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,584
They've been living comfortably
while all the gangs, ours included,

852
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,419
bring them anything in exchange for water.

853
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:48,921
What do you give to them in return?

854
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,339
People.

855
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,050
In the beginning, they were okay
with us bringing in whoever,

856
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,844
but nowadays, they've just
been asking for children.

857
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,555
- Teenagers.
- Why children?

858
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:58,638
I don't know about that.

859
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,933
You didn't know what was happening
and sold them people?

860
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,811
- Whoa, chill!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Relax, relax.

861
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,187
Then in the Bus District,

862
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,190
when your boys tried to nab Su-na,
it was… that was for this?

863
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,359
- Yeah.
- Oh, you son of a bitch!

864
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,360
Hey, come on, come on.

865
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,612
How come you kids have such short tempers?

866
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:14,989
- Hey, come on.
- Let me go.

867
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,907
- [both speaking gibberish]
- Relax, let it go.

868
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,326
We had to make a living somehow.

869
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,329
Okay, so how did you
get past their snipers, then?

870
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,706
You can get in on…

871
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,082
[breathes deeply]

872
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,167
…delivery days. [sighs]

873
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,892
- They make sure deliveries go through.
- [Nam San] On delivery days.

874
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,756
You must be tired from all that talking.
Get some rest.

875
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,884
Well, I feel like I'm okay, actually.

876
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:36,968
Just catch some Zs.

877
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:41,307
[mouse shrieking]

878
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,811
[Teacher] Mr. Choi has taken care
of the children's grandparents.

879
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,480
Uh, our newest children are
Han Su-na and Lee Ju-ye,

880
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,357
both 18-year-old girls.

881
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,860
Uh, accounting for our two new recruits,

882
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,236
that puts us at 19 total,

883
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,281
plus they're much healthier
than we had expected.

884
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,198
I see.

885
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,367
- Take good care of those two, then.
- [Teacher] Okay.

886
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,287
And make sure enough time has passed
since they've had clean water.

887
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,165
- You know what to do.
- I'll make the preparations right away.

888
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,167
I'll visit them later this afternoon.

889
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,251
Alright, get to it.

890
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,255
- You've got a little something there.
- [Kwon] Let's go.

891
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,434
Hello, everyone.

892
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,938
Here, this way.

893
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,148
Stand here.

894
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,735
Attention, and bow.

895
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,528
Nice to meet you.

896
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,823
Alright, everybody.

897
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:44,286
We have some new friends today.
Ju-ye, go ahead and introduce yourself.

898
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,996
Oh, okay. Uh…

899
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,123
Hello, everyone!

900
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,958
It's so nice to meet you.

901
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,835
I'm Ju-ye, and I'm 18.

902
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,546
I like eating,
and I really don't like bugs.

903
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,048
Uh, thank you so much!

904
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,891
- [Teacher] Let's give her a hand.
- [applause]

905
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,469
It's so nice to have you. And you, Su-na?

906
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:04,681
Su-na?

907
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,810
[chuckles] No need to be nervous.

908
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:08,894
You can just say hi.

909
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,901
Hi, I'm… Han Su-na.

910
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,153
I like drawing, um,

911
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,237
and I don't like…

912
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:22,241
living with others.

913
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,912
- Alright! Welcome!
- [Ju-ye giggles]

914
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:30,332
There. You can sit over there
at those empty desks.

915
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:31,709
- [Ju-ye] Okay.
- There you go.

916
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,753
[Ju-ye] Hello!

917
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:41,218
[Teacher] Alright. Today, we'll learn why
we need to change our metabolism.

918
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,053
Open your books, everyone.

919
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:47,683
Let's first talk about
the anatomy of humans as things stand.

920
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:51,687
Because we currently need to drink water
and consume food

921
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,105
in order to survive,

922
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:57,818
we've wasted precious resources on people
that do not serve the greater cause.

923
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,280
To be frank, we are weak,

924
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,366
and in our current world,
which is plagued by a shortage of water,

925
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:08,787
mankind needs to take
a new, stronger physical form.

926
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,291
We must develop a new metabolic system

927
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:15,002
in order to breed humans that can survive

928
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,881
for extended periods
of dehydration and malnutrition,

929
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:21,884
thereby reversing the population decline

930
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:26,388
and paving the way
for civilization to be reborn.

931
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:27,347
Children,

932
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:30,225
in this harsh and unforgiving world,

933
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:34,271
always remind yourselves
of Dr. Yang Gi-su's miracle

934
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:37,107
and of your own responsibilities.

935
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:41,403
Our metabolism will improve through
Dr. Yang's research, and eventually,

936
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:44,531
mankind will finally be given a body

937
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,825
which can adapt to this brave new world.

938
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:48,744
Pay attention, Su-na.

939
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:54,166
It's just odd.

940
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,710
Nobody even has enough to drink
on the outside,

941
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:59,880
yet the people here are able to drink
however much they want and even shower.

942
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,716
Everyone keeps going on and on
about Dr. Yang Gi-su.

943
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:07,304
Shouldn't he be giving water
to everybody out there who needs it?

944
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,598
[unsettling music playing]

945
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,603
Oh, Su-na.

946
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:17,314
The outside world is full of barbarians.

947
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:21,527
The exact same type that killed
Yang Gi-su's beloved daughter.

948
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,572
In order to join the new humanity,

949
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:29,535
you need to be the right kind of person.

950
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,119
What kind…

951
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:32,955
what kind of person is that?

952
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:37,000
[Ju-ye] People that offer aid
in furthering the doctor's research.

953
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,711
I wanna be a part of the research support.

954
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:45,843
Well, you sound like
you have the right attitude, Ju-ye, no?

955
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,679
Su-na sure could learn a lot from you.

956
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,888
[Ju-ye] Yes, ma'am.

957
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,224
[Teacher] Now, then, for our next lesson,

958
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:56,728
we'll be learning about organisms
that are best at surviving in the wild.

959
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:59,398
We'll be getting a visit
from Dr. Yang Gi-su later,

960
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,694
so let's all welcome him properly

961
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,987
to show our gratitude.

962
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,321
[all] Yes.

963
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,115
[exhales]

964
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,498
[Teacher] These rations are
the fruits of your parents' hard work,

965
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,083
as I'm sure you're all aware.

966
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,752
Let us all dig in with a thankful heart.

967
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:21,962
And there's the water,

968
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:25,299
which is more valuable
than anything else in this world.

969
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,176
Make sure to drink it all
down to the very last drop.

970
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,889
Dr. Yang Gi-su had it specially purified
for all of you here.

971
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,639
Ju-ye.

972
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,351
[Gi-su] Hello, everyone.

973
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:39,688
[Teacher] Alright,
a round of applause, everyone.

974
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,065
Attention.

975
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,149
Bow.

976
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,820
"Students are our hope."

977
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:49,573
I'm sure you're all aware
of our apartment's motto, right?

978
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:53,911
That's the reason we've been supplying
our students with a special diet.

979
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:58,790
[inhales] The world is beset by a shortage
of food and water, as you know.

980
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:01,418
I'm working day and night
to create a new world

981
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,671
where humans are going to be able
to survive and live a good life

982
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,549
with only a minuscule amount
of food and drinking water.

983
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,384
But until that day comes,

984
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:12,095
you all need to finish
everything you're given,

985
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,472
making sure not to waste any.

986
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,555
Yes.

987
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,391
Alright.

988
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,185
Doctor, we have someone very promising.

989
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,895
- Oh, there.
- Mm-hmm. She's wonderful.

990
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:20,812
Her name?

991
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:21,896
[Teacher] Lee Ju-ye.

992
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:24,107
[Gi-su] Lee Ju-ye, right?

993
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,191
Yes.

994
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,778
Hi. You're 18?

995
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,071
Yeah!

996
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,406
I heard you really wanted to help me
with my research.

997
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,490
[Ju-ye] Mm.

998
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,428
Why don't we get the ball rolling
with a consultation?

999
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,813
- [Teacher] Yes, of course.
- Uh-huh.

1000
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:39,289
Well, uh, why don't we have you eat first?

1001
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,875
Uh, I'll send someone over to meet you

1002
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,252
in three hours, huh?
And then we can get started.

1003
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,630
Oh wow! Thank you, Doctor. [giggles]

1004
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,174
- [Gi-su] Right.
- Let's go.

1005
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,426
Dr. Yang.

1006
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:56,098
Where's my grandmother?
Did she get here safe?

1007
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,101
Of course she did. Don't you worry.

1008
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,312
If my grandmother's here, I wanna see her.

1009
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,273
[Gi-su exhales in annoyance]

1010
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:08,526
Excuse me.

1011
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,655
Did you explain everything to her?

1012
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:12,738
[gasps]

1013
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,365
I'm so sorry.

1014
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,369
[unsettling music playing]

1015
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,453
Su-na.

1016
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:22,374
Uh, your grandmother is much worse
than we expected,

1017
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,752
so we'll have to keep her in treatment
for the next two to three days.

1018
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:28,130
Grandma got that sick on the way here?

1019
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,214
[chuckles nervously]

1020
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,801
She just needs to rest, okay?

1021
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:35,345
You're going to be able
to see her in a day or so.

1022
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,658
Dr. Yang Gi-su himself is
personally seeing to her treatment...

1023
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:40,017
Yes, of course. Now,

1024
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,270
I have been overseeing her care,
so don't worry, okay?

1025
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,480
She's going to be much better soon,

1026
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:46,440
and…

1027
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,858
Oh, Su-na.

1028
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:51,236
Su-na, you're terribly malnourished
right now. Huh?

1029
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,946
So drink some water.

1030
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,323
You'll regain your health. Here.

1031
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,163
Hmm?

1032
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,340
Alright, then. Enjoy your dinners,

1033
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,551
and don't forget,

1034
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,344
you are our future!

1035
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,693

[exhales forcefully]

1039
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,753
- Alright, clean things up here.
- [woman] Yes, sir.

1040
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,714
It's been over 20 hours,

1041
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:55,050
and Sergeant Choi
and Sergeant Oh haven't returned.

1042
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,928
Things could get bad for them
if they don't make it in time.

1043
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:00,180
[Gi-su] They should be okay.

1044
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,184
Maybe we should hand out personal doses

1045
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,936
in case of situations like this.

1046
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,687
[sighs]

1047
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,148
It's still too dangerous
for people to carry.

1048
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:13,860
Besides, there's no telling what kind
of side effects we'll see going forward.

1049
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,446
How long are
we going to have to keep injecting?

1050
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,367
We're starting to run out of children
to bring to the apartment.

1051
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:23,662
We're gonna get there.

1052
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:26,706
Just be patient.

1053

They only care about themselves.

1056

Dignity for humans?

[breathes deeply]

1059
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:44,641
This research needs to
come to fruition, right?

1060
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:47,686
If we want a meaningful life…

1061
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,148
it'll only be when…

1062
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:52,816
when they realize

1063
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,235
the sacrifices
of these evolutionary rejects

1064

[chuckles]

1075
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:55,212
Uh, we, uh, signed up
to see our child earlier on.

1076
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,796
When will we be able to go see her?

1077
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,632
A meeting? What do you mean, meeting?

1078
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,051
The teacher said
that after we finish our work for the day,

1079
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,695
we could sign up to visit our daughter.

1080
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,762
Uh, there's, um…

1081
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:07,307
- We don't have that policy.
- She definitely told us that earlier on.

1082
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:10,453
We're happy to go to the eighth floor
if Ju-ye can't come down.

1083
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:14,064
The eighth floor is especially off-limits
to regular residents.

01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,399
Uh, well, where's the teacher, then?

[sighs] You know what?
Where's our daughter?

1086
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:22,364
What the hell do you mean
we can't go see our child?

1087
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,281
This is ridiculous!

1088

[man] They're stopping them
seeing their child.

1089

[woman] I hope our kids are okay.

Don't mind us and change shifts, everyone.

We'll talk about this tomorrow.

- Wait, wait, wait. Where's Ju-ye?
- No, look here.

do I have to tell you

1098
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:04,948
not to interrupt me
when I'm experimenting?

1099

I'm sorry, sir. Too many witnesses
for me to take care of it.

that we would be able to see her tonight!

[man 1] Why do you keep lying to us?

1118
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,635
Hey, what's going on?

1119
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,304
Huh? What's this about? Guys…

1120
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,848
Please, Doctor, please tell us.
Where is Ju-ye?

1121
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,099
You guys,

1122
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:15,727
you said we could meet her.
You can't just go back on your word!

1123
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,270
Calm down, please!

1124
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,772
Ju-ye is doing great.

1125
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:22,400
- She's all settled in now.
- Doctor, please let us see our daughter.

1126
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:24,152
- Now, wait, wait, don't…
- I'm begging you!

1127
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:27,447
[Gi-su] There's no need to cry.
Please, please settle down.

1128
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,615
[inhales deeply]

1129
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,574
Okay, fine.

1130
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:34,329
Let's go to the lab to see her.
Come with me. Let's go see Ju-ye.

1131
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,832
Let's go. Yeah.

1132
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:40,877
[man] Okay, thank you. Let's go.

Ju-ye…

1141
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,202
Ju-ye. [panting]

1142
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,501
- [door opens]
- [Gi-su] This way.

1143
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:07,589
[man] So… so she's in here?

1144
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,842
Why would, uh…

1145
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,511
[Gi-su] There, see that? She's fine.

1146
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:16,097
- [woman] Ju-ye!
- [man] Ju-ye… Ju-ye!

1147
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:18,433
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
don't stimulate her in any way!

1148
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,727
- Or else you'll put her life at risk.
- [woman whimpers]

1149
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,896
You can see
that she's a very valuable asset here

1150
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,856
and giving herself for us all.

1151
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,233
Doctor, can you explain what this is?

1152
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:29,319
Is Ju-ye sick or something?

1153
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,778
No, she's completely healthy.

1154
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:33,031
It's just that kids her age
have something right here.

1155
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,325
- [woman whimpers]
- "The children are our future."

1156
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,729
That's our whole motto, isn't it?

[Gi-su sighs]

01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:42,248
Now, now, now, here, look.
This is my daughter.

1160
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,626
Everyone said that she was dead,
but I brought her back.

1161
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:47,629
I've basically created
an undying breed of humanity.

What?

1166
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,393
Humanity has a chance at being preserved,

1167
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:04,103
thanks to you and your daughter.

1168
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:07,398
Now do you understand what a vital role
she plays in this research?

1169
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:09,234
[groans in disgust] Ju-ye.

1170
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:12,737
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I said not to stimulate your daughter!

1171
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,657
Jesus! I told you not to touch her! Shit!

- [alarms wailing]
- [choking]

1173
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,118
What's wrong with her?

1174
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,787
What's going on with our daughter?

1175
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,997
- What's happening?
- [man] Ju-ye!

1176
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,874
[Gi-su] I told you not to touch her!

1177
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,545
[woman] Oh my God, do something!

1178
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,880
[sobbing] Do something!

1179
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,634
What's wrong with her?

1180
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:37,720
What's happening to her?

1181
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,515

1185
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,527
- [sighs]
- [woman] Wake up, Ju-ye.

1186
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,362
[Gi-su] I was away for too long.

1187
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,323
I told you what would happen. Now look!

1188
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,158
- [man] Ju-ye…
- [woman] Ju-ye?

1189
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:00,493
[man] Ju-ye!

1190
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:02,912

[shrieks]

1193
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,127
You have no idea

1194
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,838
how important this research is, do you?

1195
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:12,964
[yells angrily]

1196
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:17,218
I gave you food, clean water,

1197
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:18,302
shelter…

1198
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:20,471
Why don't you trust me?!

1199

Clean-up crew. Clean-up crew to the lab.

[unsettling music playing]

1206
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,102
Su-na,

1207
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:10,730
why are you up here?

1208
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,109
What a coincidence, huh?

1209
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,160
I really appreciate
you having my back on this.

1210
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,539
There's no way in hell
I could do this alone, you know?

1211
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,958
[sighs wearily] I'm just here for Su-na.

1212
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:33,670
And also 'cause

1213
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:36,506
he'll shut his trap
when Su-na's around again.

1214
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,885
I'm not a good person.

1215
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:44,972
There's a lot of blood on my hands.

1216
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:48,308
[sucks teeth]

1217
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,977
It's morning now.

1218
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,146
Rise and shine.

1219
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,816
[yawns] We're leaving already?

1220
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:55,900
[sniffs]

1221
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,320

- [melancholy music playing]
- [Su-na breathing anxiously]

1223
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:15,002
[Gi-su] Sure must be nice, being so young.
Very minimal side effects,

1224
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,922
and the drugs work great on you.

1225
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,049
I know why you're keeping
all these children.

1226
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,886
You're using us like lab rats
so you can survive.

1227
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,222
Oh, no, don't worry.

1228
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,474
You're better than a lab rat.

1229
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,352
No, we're depending on you to survive.

1230
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:34,355
What happened to Ju-ye earlier
was very unfortunate.

1231
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,733
Why are you
experimenting on children's necks?

1232
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:41,237
The teenage pituitary gland generates
material that allows the process to occur.

1233
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,866
Now, it does need a bit of fine-tuning.
Doesn't work right away.

1234
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,952
In the classroom,
when you were drinking the water?

1235
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,035
That activates it.

1236
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,246
It's amazing, right?

1237
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:53,166
That we're able to achieve that
with just a little water?

1238
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:56,419
Where's Grandma, then?

1239
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,629
- [keyboard clacking]
- [chuckles]

1240
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:01,340
Did you seriously believe
she's in treatment?

1241
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:05,595
The weak among us need to be thinned out

1242
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:08,306
so we can make way for the new breed.

1243
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:09,223

- Whoa, stay still.

1245
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,237
- Hey, don't screw this up, okay?
- Trust me, alright?

1246
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:28,743
[chuckles pleasantly]

1247
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:30,077
Hey, how you doing?

1248
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,204
What happened to you?

1249
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,581
Oh, I just got into a scuffle

1250
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:36,667
with some crazy gorilla motherfucker
a couple days ago.

1251
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,232
[soldier] What brings you here today?

1252
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,005
I'm here to make a delivery, bro. [laughs]

1253
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:43,424
You're only supposed to come
on certain days, you know?

1254
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:45,426
Oh shit.

1255
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,304
Well, you know, I was just passing by,

1256
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:51,808
so I figured I'd make a delivery
and come see my buddy while I'm at it.

1257
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:54,477
- [tense music playing]
- Hey, what's with that?

1258
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,354
- Look in the back.
- [soldier 2] Yes, sir.

1259
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,106
Shut it off.

1260
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:01,359

What's going on?

1264
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:17,959
[Tiger] Whoa!

1265
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,378
Whoa, whoa!

1266
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,301
- [tires screech]
- Hold on to something!

1267
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,934
Ah, slow down, slow down!

1268
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:39,981
Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1269
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:49,031
Hey, you son of a bitch!

1270
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:52,118

Let's get Yang Gi-su.

01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:38,543
We might lose him if we go together.
You take the kids and move down.

Hurry.

01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:54,058
What the fuck is in the bag?

1604

[woman] You will pay for this!
You're gonna rot!

Wait!

You all deserve to die, all of you.

1618
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:44,567
I should kill every one of you.
Good-for-nothing, evolutionary rejects!

It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

Uh, thanks, but I'm sober.

What's with that ribbon she's wearing?
