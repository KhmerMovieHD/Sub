Am I supposed to know
what that is?

475
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:25,461
Orichalcum is a power source
that was used in ancient times.

476
00:35:25,596 --> 00:35:28,198
It emits tremendous amounts
of greenhouse gases

477
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,972
that are highly destructive
to our planet.

478
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:32,763
In fact, we almost destroyed
the oceans ourselves

479
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:35,538
before we realized
what we were doing.

480
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:39,037
It can't be disposed of safely,
so the remaining stockpile

481
00:35:39,172 --> 00:35:42,743
has been buried in 12 storage
vaults deep underground.

482
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:44,754
We should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

483
00:35:44,778 --> 00:35:47,449
He's already been there.
It's all gone.

484
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,413
We think he's been
launching secret raids

485
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:51,319
for at least five months.

486
00:35:51,455 --> 00:35:52,855
This is just the time
he got caught.

487
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:54,454
Well, this spike
in global temperatures

488
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,286
that's causing disasters
on the surface

489
00:35:56,422 --> 00:36:01,158
and making the sea dwellers
sick happened five months ago.

490
00:36:01,294 --> 00:36:04,796
He's using the stolen
orichalcum to heat the planet.

491
00:36:06,466 --> 00:36:08,371
Why would he do that?

492
00:36:08,506 --> 00:36:10,369
[AQUAMAN] I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

493
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:13,804
If he is using the orichalcum to heat
the planet, we don't have much time.

494
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,910
He is pushing this
past the tipping point.

495
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:20,445
He must be stopped or a global
climate meltdown is imminent.

496
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:21,879
[NEREUS] We need to find him,

497
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:23,694

vanished off the radar.

498
00:36:23,786 --> 00:36:26,323
I think I know someone
who might be able to help us.

499
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,886
But you're not gonna like it.

500

Your brother?

501
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,541
Believe me, he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help,

502
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:36,292
but he's dealt with Manta
in the past,

503
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,711
and he's the only one who might
know how to find him in time.

The Fishermen will never
allow you to speak to Orm.

505

He killed their king.

I wasn't exactly
gonna ask for permission.

507
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:51,475
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract
Orm from an allied nation.

508
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:53,977
It would be an act of war.

510

I'm gonna break him out myself.

511
00:37:00,024 --> 00:37:03,583
Arthur, Karshon is looking for
a reason to seize war powers.
